<h2>THE MOUNTAIN DIVIDE</h2>
<div class='chsp' style='padding-top:0'>
<a name='CHAPTER_I' id='CHAPTER_I'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>
<p>Night had fallen and a warm rain drifting
down from the mountains hung in a mist over
the railroad yards and obscured the lights of
Medicine Bend. Two men dismounting from
their drooping horses at the foot of Front Street
threw the reins to a man in waiting and made
their way on foot across the muddy square to the
building which served the new railroad as a station
and as division head-quarters. In Medicine
Bend, the town, the railroad, everything was
new; and the broad, low pine building which
they entered had not yet been painted.</p>
<p>The public waiting-room was large, roughly
framed, and lighted with hanging kerosene lamps.
Within the room a door communicated with the
agent&#8217;s office, and this was divided by a wooden
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
railing into a freight office and a ticket and telegraph
office.</p>
<p>It could be seen, as the two men paused at the
door of the inner room, that the first wore a military
fatigue-cap, and his alert carriage as he threw
open his cape-coat indicated the bearing of an
American army officer. He was of medium height,
and his features and eyes implied that the storms
and winds of the plains and mountains were familiar
friends. This was Park Stanley, charged at
that time with the construction of the first transcontinental
railroad.</p>
<p>The agent&#8217;s office, which he and his companion
now looked into, was half-filled with a crowd of
frontiersmen, smoking, talking, disputing, asking
questions, and crowding against the fence that
railed off the private end of the room; while
at the operator&#8217;s table next to the platform window
a tall, spindling boy was trying in the confusion
behind him to get a message off the wire.</p>
<p>Stanley, eying the lad, noticed how thin his
face was and what a bony frame spread out under
the roundabout jacket that he appeared already
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
to have outgrown. And he concluded this must
be the new operator, Bucks, who for some days
had been expected from the East.</p>
<p>The receiver clicked insistently and Bucks endeavored
to follow the message, but the babel
of talking made it almost impossible. Stanley
heard the boy appeal more than once for less
noise, but his appeals were unheeded. He saw
symptoms of fire in the operator&#8217;s eyes as the
latter glared occasionally at the crowd behind
him, but for what followed even Stanley was
unprepared. Bucks threw down his pen and
coming forward with angry impatience ordered
the crowd out of the room.</p>
<p>He pushed the foremost of the intruders back
from the rail and followed up his commands
by opening the wicket gate and driving those
ahead of him toward the door of the waiting-room.
&#8220;Get out where you belong,&#8221; he repeated,
urging the crowd on. Stanley turned to the
man at his side. &#8220;I will go upstairs to write my
message. This must be the new boy, Bob,&#8221; he
added; &#8220;he acts as if he might make things go.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span></div>
<p>His companion, Bob Scott, smiled as he followed
Stanley out upon the platform and up the
narrow stairway leading to the division offices.
But Bob Scott was conservative. He never
spoke above an undertone and naturally took the
conservative side: &#8220;If he only doesn&#8217;t make them
go too fast, Colonel,&#8221; was his comment.</p>
<p>A tall young man, spare but almost gigantic
in stature, standing back in one corner of the
agent&#8217;s office as the men about him were hustled
along, likewise regarded Bucks with surprise
as he saw him start single-handed to expel the
intruders. This was the mountain telegraph lineman,
Bill Dancing, as simple as he was strong,
and ready at any time to be surprised, but not
often disconcerted. In this instance, however,
he was amazed, for almost before he realized it
the energetic operator was hustling him out with
the others.</p>
<p>When Bucks thought the room cleared he turned
to go back to his table, but he saw that one
man had been overlooked. This man was still
sitting on a stool in the farthest corner of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
dimly lighted room. The spindling operator
without hesitation walked over to him and laid
his hand on the man&#8217;s shoulder. Dancing, looking
back through the door, held his breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Move out of here, please,&#8221; said Bucks, &#8220;into
the public waiting-room.&#8221; The man rose with the
utmost politeness. &#8220;Sorry to be in your way,&#8221;
he returned mildly, though there was a note not
quite pleasant in his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your place is outside,&#8221; continued the operator.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t do anything with a mob in here all talking
at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t done my talking yet,&#8221; suggested the
man, with a shade of significance. This, however,
was lost on Bucks, who looked sharply at the stool
from which the man had risen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think this stool is mine,&#8221; said he, picking it
up and examining it. &#8220;It is mine,&#8221; he added,
after a moment&#8217;s inspection. &#8220;Please move on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps before I go,&#8221; returned the man with
the same unpleasant irony, &#8220;you will tell me
whether you have an express package here for
Harvey Levake.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Of course I will, Harvey,&#8221; responded the operator
in a matter-of-fact way. &#8220;Just wait a
minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>Levake&#8217;s lips stretched into a ghost of a smile,
and his white-lashed gray eyes contracted with
an effort at amiability.</p>
<p>The operator, going inside the railing, ran over
the express way-bills which, not yet entered up,
lay on the freight desk.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a package here for you,&#8221; he announced
a moment later, and turning to a heap
of parcels thrown under the desk he searched
among them until he found and produced the
one he sought.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here it is&ndash;&ndash;a box of cartridges.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are the charges?&#8221; asked the man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Four dollars and sixty cents.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man laid down a twenty-dollar bank-bill.
The operator hesitated: &#8220;I haven&#8217;t the change.&#8221;</p>
<p>Levake showed no sympathy: &#8220;That is not my
fault,&#8221; he returned.</p>
<p>The operator looked at him: &#8220;Do you want the
package to-night?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span></div>
<p>&#8220;If I didn&#8217;t, do you suppose I would waste an
hour here waiting for it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy considered a moment and made a decision,
but it chanced to be the wrong decision.
&#8220;Take the package along. Bring me the charges
in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Levake made no response beyond a further
glance at the boy somewhat contemptuous; but
he said nothing and picking up his package walked
out. No one opposed him. Indeed, had the operator
been interested he would have noticed with
what marked alacrity every man, as he passed
through the waiting-room, got out of Levake&#8217;s
way. Dancing, standing at the door and with
his hair on end, awaited the close of the incident.
He now re-entered the inner office and shut the
waiting-room door behind him with an audible
bang. Bucks, who had returned to his table,
looked around. &#8220;Well, who are you?&#8221; he demanded
as he regarded Dancing. &#8220;And what
are you doing here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; retorted Dancing bluntly.
&#8220;And what are you doing here?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></div>
<p>&#8220;My name is Bucks and I am the new night
operator.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You look new. And you act all-fired new.
My name is Bill Dancing and I am the telegraph
lineman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you are the man I am looking for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I thought, when you pushed me out of
here with the rest of your visitors.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you speak up, Bill?&#8221; demanded
Bucks calmly.</p>
<p>A quizzical expression passed over Dancing&#8217;s
face. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to break the calm. When
I see a man walking around a powder magazine
I hate to do anything that might set it off.</p>
<p>&#8220;So your name is Bucks,&#8221; continued Dancing,
as he walked through the wicket and threw his
wet hat among the way-bills on the freight desk.
&#8220;Well, Mr. Bucks, do you know what was most
likely to happen to you any minute before you got
through with that crowd, just now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t know. Why?&#8221; asked Bucks,
busy with his messages.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you ever seen a shooting mix-up in Medicine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
Bend?&#8221; demanded Dancing in a tone of calculated
indifference.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Bucks in decided but off-hand
manner, &#8220;I never saw a shooting mix-up anywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never got shot up just for fun?&#8221; persisted
Dancing. &#8220;Do you know,&#8221; he continued without
waiting for an answer, &#8220;who that polite man
was, the last one you shouldered out of here?&#8221;
Dancing pointed as he spoke to the corner from
which Levake had risen, but the operator, straightening
out the papers before him, did not look
around.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Bill, I don&#8217;t know anybody here. You
see I am a stranger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you are a stranger,&#8221; echoed Dancing.
&#8220;Let me tell you something, then, will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell it quick, Bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no cemetery in this town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have understood it is very healthy, Bill,&#8221;
returned the operator.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for everybody.&#8221; Bill Dancing paused to
let the words sink in, as his big eyes fixed upon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
the young operator&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;Not for everybody&ndash;&ndash;sometimes
not for strangers. Strangers have to
get used to it. There is a river here,&#8221; added the
lineman sententiously. &#8220;It&#8217;s pretty swift, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean you have got to be careful how you
do things out in this country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Bill,&#8221; persisted the lad, &#8220;if there is going
to be any business done in this office we have
got to have order, haven&#8217;t we?&#8221; The lineman
snorted and the operator saw that his appeal
had fallen flat. &#8220;My batteries, Bill,&#8221; he added,
changing the subject, &#8220;are no good at all. I sent
for you because I want you to go over them now,
to-night, and start me right. What are you going
to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dancing had begun to poke at the ashes in the
stove. &#8220;Build a fire,&#8221; he returned, looking about
for material. He gathered up what waste paper
was at hand, pushed it into the stove, and catching
up the way-bills from the desk, threw them
in on the paper and began to feel in his wet
pockets for matches.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Hold on,&#8221; cried Bucks. &#8220;What do you mean?
You must be crazy!&#8221; he exclaimed, running to the
stove and pulling the way-bills out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not half so crazy as you are,&#8221; replied Dancing
undisturbed. &#8220;I&#8217;m only trying to show you
how crazy you are. Burning up way-bills isn&#8217;t a
circumstance to what you did just now. You
are the looniest operator I ever saw.&#8221; As he
looked at Bucks he extended his finger impressively.
&#8220;When you laid your hand on that
man&#8217;s shoulder to-night&ndash;&ndash;the one sitting on your
stool&ndash;&ndash;I wouldn&#8217;t have given ten cents for your
life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucks regarded him with astonishment. &#8220;Why
so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the meanest man between here and Fort
Bridger,&#8221; asserted Dancing. &#8220;He&#8217;d think no
more of shooting you than I would of scratching
a match.&#8221; Bucks stared at the comparison. &#8220;He
is the worst scoundrel in this country and partners
with Seagrue and John Rebstock in everything
that&#8217;s going on, and even they are afraid of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dancing stopped for breath. &#8220;Talk about my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
making a fire out of way-bills! When I saw you
lay your hand on that man, I stopped breathing&ndash;&ndash;can&#8217;t
breathe just right yet,&#8221; he muttered, pulling
at his shirt collar. &#8220;Do you know why you
didn&#8217;t get killed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no, Bill, not exactly,&#8221; confessed Bucks
in embarrassment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because Levake was out of cartridges. I
heard him tell Rebstock so when they walked
past me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for posting me. How should I
know he was Seagrue&#8217;s partner, or who Rebstock
is? Let&#8217;s make a bargain. I will be more careful
in clearing out the office, and you be more
careful about building fires. There&#8217;s wood in the
baggage-room. I couldn&#8217;t get out to get it for
fear the crowd would steal the tickets.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you are &#8216;out&#8217; four dollars and sixty cents
charges on the cartridges,&#8221; continued Dancing,
&#8220;and you had better say nothing about it. If
you ever ask Levake for the money he will kill
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucks looked rebellious. &#8220;It&#8217;s only right for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
him to pay the charges. I shall ask him for them
the next time I see him. And what is more he
will have to pay, I don&#8217;t care whose partner he is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dancing now regarded the operator with unconcealed
impatience. &#8220;I suppose there are more
where you came from,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;They will
need a lot of them here, if they carry on like
that. How old are you?&#8221; he demanded of Bucks
abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seventeen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How long have you been in this country?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucks looked at the clock. &#8220;About five hours,
Bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Reckon time close, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have to, Bill, in the railroad business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dancing reflected a moment. &#8220;Five hours,&#8221; he
repeated. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t get killed within the
next five you may live to be a useful citizen of
Medicine Bend. Where are you from, and how did
you happen to come away out here on the plains?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am from Pittsburgh. I had to quit school
and go to work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you go to school?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Well, I didn&#8217;t go&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quit before you went, did you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean, I was preparing for Van Dyne College.
One of my brothers teaches there. I couldn&#8217;t start
there after I lost my father&ndash;&ndash;he was killed in the
Wilderness Campaign, Bill. But when I can
earn money enough, I am going back to Van
Dyne and take an engineering course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Got it all figured out, have you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I heard they were building the Union
Pacific, and I knew something about telegraphing&ndash;&ndash;Jim
Foster and I had a line from the house to
the barn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Had a line from the house to the barn, eh?&#8221;
chuckled Dancing.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I bought a railroad ticket to Des Moines
from Pittsburgh and staged it to Omaha, and General
Park gave me a job right away and sent me
out on the first train to take this office, nights. I
didn&#8217;t even know where Medicine Bend was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t believe you know yet. Now that&#8217;s
right, I don&#8217;t believe you know yet. You&#8217;re a
good boy, but you talk too much.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></div>
<p>&#8220;How old are you, Bill?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am twenty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty!&#8221; echoed Bucks, as if that were not
very much, either.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty!&#8221; repeated the lineman. &#8220;But,&#8221; he
added, drawing himself up in his tremendous stature,
with dignity, &#8220;I have been on the plains
driving wagons and building telegraph lines for
seven years&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seven years!&#8221; echoed Bucks, now genuinely
admiring his companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;My father was a Forty-niner. I was a
line foreman when I was seventeen, for Edward
Creighton, and we put the first telegraph line
through from the Missouri River to the Pacific,&#8221;
continued Dancing, ready to back his words with
blows if necessary.</p>
<p>&#8220;You <i>are</i> an old-timer,&#8221; cried Bucks enviously.
&#8220;Any good rabbit-shooting around here, Bill?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rabbit-shooting?&#8221; echoed Dancing in scorn.
&#8220;The only rabbits they shoot around here, young
fellow, are Pittsburgh rabbits, that don&#8217;t keep their
ears hid proper. When we go hunting, we go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
antelope-hunting, buffalo-hunting, grizzly-bear
hunting, elk-hunting. Now I don&#8217;t say I don&#8217;t
like you and I don&#8217;t say you won&#8217;t do. What
I say is, you talk too much. I&#8217;ll tell you what
I&#8217;ve learned. I&#8217;ve learned not to say too much
at a time. And when I say it, I don&#8217;t say it
very loud. And if you don&#8217;t get killed, in
advance, you will learn the same thing in the
same way I learned it. Where are your blamed
batteries?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bill, you are all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am, am I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;First help me enter these way-bills and check
up the express packages so I can deliver them
to this mob.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My business isn&#8217;t checking up express; but
I like you, young fellow, so, go ahead. Only you
talk too much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a moment!&#8221;</p>
<p>At these words coming from the other end of
the office, the lineman and the operator looked
around. The military-looking man and his companion
had entered the room unobserved and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
stood at the counter listening to the colloquy between
the Eastern boy and the plainsman&ndash;&ndash;for
neither of the two were more than boys. Dancing
saluted the new-comers. &#8220;It&#8217;s Colonel Stanley
and Bob Scott,&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>Bucks walked forward. Stanley handed him a
message. &#8220;You are the night operator? Here is
a despatch for General Park. Get it out for me
right away, will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dancing came forward to the railing. &#8220;How
are you, Bill?&#8221; said Stanley, greeting the lineman
as Bucks read the long message. &#8220;I am
going up into the mountains next week, and I
am just asking General Park for a cavalry detail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to need me, Colonel?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better hold yourself ready. Can you read
that, young man?&#8221; he asked, speaking to Bucks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lose no time in getting it off.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the words he turned on his heel and leaving
the office went upstairs to the despatcher&#8217;s
rooms. During the interval that the message was
being sent, Dancing worked at the express matter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
While the two were busy, Bob Scott, moving
so quietly that he disturbed no one, laid carefully
upon the smouldering paper in the stove such
chips as he could pick from the wood-box, nursing
and developing a little blaze until, without
noise or fuss, he soon had a good fire going. In
all of the mountain country there was but one
kind of men who built fires in that way and these
were Indians.</p>
<p>Such was Bob Scott, who, wet to the skin from
his ride down the hills with Stanley, now stood
slowly drying himself and watching Dancing and
the new operator.</p>
<p>Scott was a half-blood Chippewa Indian, silent
as a mountain night and as patient as time. He
served Colonel Stanley as guide and scout wherever
the railroad man rode upon his surveys or
reconnoissances. Dancing, emerging presently
from the batteries, greeted Scott again, this time
boisterously. The Indian only smiled, but his
face reflected the warmth of his friendship for
the big lineman. And at this juncture Dancing,
slapping him on the shoulder, turned to introduce
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
him to Bucks. The three stood and talked
a moment together, though, perhaps, without
realizing what they were almost at once to go
through together. The outgoing Eastern passenger
train now pulled up to the platform and
Bucks was kept busy for some time selling tickets.</p>
<p>His buyers were all sorts and conditions of men.
And one forlorn-looking woman, with a babe in
her arms and a little girl clinging to her skirt,
asked the price of a ticket to Omaha. When told,
she turned away to count her money. Among
the men were traders and frontiersmen going
to Missouri River markets with buffalo robes;
trappers from the Big Horn country with furs;
Mormon elders on their way from Utah to
their Eastern settlements; soldiers on furlough
and men from the railroad-construction camps
on the front; adventurers, disgusted with the
hardships of frontier life, and gamblers and desperadoes,
restless and always moving.</p>
<p>Bucks needed his wits to watch the money that
was pushed under his little wicket and to make
change without mistake. There was elbowing and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
contention and bad language, but the troublesome
crowd was finally disposed of, and when the last
of the line had left the ticket window the waiting-room
was pretty well cleared. There remained
only a black-bearded man half-asleep in a chair
by the stove, and in one corner on a bench the
woman, who was trying to quiet the child she
held in her lap.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>
<p>As Bucks looked through his embrasure to see
if all had been served, his eye fell on the group
in the corner and he heard the woman suppressing
the sobbing of her little girl. He walked out into
the waiting-room to ask what the trouble was. He
learned afterward that she was the wife of a gambler,
but she told him only that she had followed
her husband to Medicine Bend and was now trying
to get back with her two children to her parents
in Iowa. When she had ascertained the price of
the railroad ticket she found that she lacked five
dollars of the sum needed to make up the fare.
Bucks had just a little money of his own, but he
had counted on using that for his meals. While
he was debating what to do, the elder child tugging
still at the mother&#8217;s dress asked for something
to eat, and while the mother tried to quiet
it Bucks felt he could manage somehow without
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
the price of the ticket better than this woman
could.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me what money you have,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
will get you a ticket.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But isn&#8217;t the train gone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>The black-bearded man dozing near the stove
had his ears open although his eyes were closed.
He had heard fragments of the talk and saw the
boy dig into his own pocket, as he would have
expressed it, to start the woman home. After
Bucks had given her the ticket and she was trying
to thank him and to quiet again the tired
child, the drowsy man rose, picked up the woman&#8217;s
hand-bag and told her gruffly he would put
her on the train. As he started with her out
into the drizzling rain, he carried her little girl,
and, stopping down the platform at a sheltered
lunch-counter, he bought a bag of doughnuts big
enough to sink a ship. He offered no money to
the man at the counter, but his credit seemed
unquestioned. In the train the seats appeared all
to be taken, but the drowsy man again showed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
his authority by rolling a tipsy fellow out of a
seat and piling him up in a corner near the stove&ndash;&ndash;which
fortunately had no fire in it.</p>
<p>During all this time he had not said a word.
But at the last, having placed the woman and the
children in two seats and made them comfortable,
he asked the mother one question&ndash;&ndash;her husband&#8217;s
name. She told him, and, without any comment
or good-bys, he left the car and started through
the rain uptown.</p>
<p>After the train pulled out, the wind shifted
and the rain changed into a snow which, driven
from the mountains, thickened on the wet window
in front of the operator&#8217;s table. A message came
for the night yardmaster, and the operator, seeing
the head-light of the switch-engine which was
working close by, put on his cap and stepped out
to deliver the message. As he opened the waiting-room
door, a man confronted him&ndash;&ndash;the bearded
man who had taken the woman and children to
the train. Bucks saw under the visor of a cloth
cap, a straight white nose, a dark eye piercingly
keen, and a rather long, glossy, black beard.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
It was the passenger conductor, David Hawk.
Without speaking, Hawk held out his hand with
a five-dollar bank note in it.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is this?&#8221; asked Bucks.</p>
<p>&#8220;The money you gave the woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucks, taking the bill, regarded his visitor with
surprise. &#8220;Where did you get this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask questions,&#8221; returned Hawk brusquely.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got your money, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough.&#8221; And with Bucks staring at
him, Hawk, without a word or a smile, walked
out of the station.</p>
<p>But Bill Dancing had seen the incident and was
ready to answer Bucks&#8217;s question as he turned
with the money in his hand. &#8220;That is Dave
Hawk,&#8221; explained Dancing. &#8220;Dave hates a sneak.
The way he got the money from the woman&#8217;s
husband was probably by telling him if he didn&#8217;t
pay for his wife&#8217;s ticket and add enough to
feed her and her babies to the river he would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
blow his head off. Dave doesn&#8217;t explain things
especially.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucks put the money in his pocket and started
on with his message. The yards covered the
wide flat along the river. Medicine Bend was
then the western operating point for the railroad
and the distributing point for all material used
in the advancing construction through the mountains.</p>
<p>Not until he left the shelter of the station
building did he realize the force of the storm that
was now sweeping across the flat. The wind had
swung into the northwest and blew almost a gale
and the snow stung his face as he started across
the dark yard. There were practically no lights
at all beyond the platform except those in the
roundhouse, too far away to be seen, but the
operator saw the moving head-light of the switch-engine
and hastened across the slippery tracks
toward it. The crew were making up a material
train to send west and the engine was snorting
and puffing among long strings of flat cars loaded
with rails, ties, stringers, and bridge timbers.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></div>
<p>As Bucks neared the working engine it receded
from him, and following it up he soon found his
feet slipping in the wet mud and the wind at
times taking his breath. Conscious of the folly
of running farther, he halted for a moment and
turning his back to the storm resolved to wait
till the engine returned. He chose a spot under
the lee of a box-car, and was soon rewarded by
hearing a new movement from the working engine.
By the increasing noise of the open cylinder
cocks he concluded it was backing toward
him. He stepped across the nearest track to
reach a switch-stand, a car-length away, whence
he thought he could signal the engine with his
lantern. He had nearly reached the switch when
his foot slipped from a rail into a frog that held
him fast. Holding his lantern down, he saw
how he was caught and tried to free his heel.
It seemed as if it might easily be done, but
the more he worked the faster caught he found
himself. For a moment he still made sure he
could loosen his foot. Even when he realized
that this was not easy, he felt no alarm until
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
he heard the switch-engine whistle. Through the
driving snow he could see that it was coming
toward him, pushing ahead of it a lead of flat
cars.</p>
<p>Bucks was no stranger to railroad yards even
then, and the realization of his peril flashed
across his mind. He renewed his efforts to loosen
his imprisoned heel. They were useless. He stood
caught in the iron vice. A sweat of fear moistened
his forehead. He hoped for an instant that
the moving cars were not coming on his track;
but almost at once he saw that they were being
pushed toward the very switch he was trying to
reach. Even where he stood, struggling, he was
not six feet away from the switch-stand and
safety. It seemed as if he could almost reach it,
as he writhed and twisted in his agony of apprehension.</p>
<p>He swung his lantern frantically, hoping to
catch the eye of one of the switching crew. But
the only answer was the heavy pounding of the
loaded cars over the rail joints as they were pushed
down upon the helpless operator. Worst of all,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
while he was swinging his lantern high in the
air, the wind sucked the flame up into the globe
and it went out and left him helpless in the dark.
Like the hare caught in the steel teeth of a trap,
the boy stood in the storm facing impending
death.</p>
<p>The bitterest feelings overwhelmed him. After
coming hundreds of miles and plunging into his
work with the most complacent self-confidence,
he stood before the close of the first day about
to be snuffed out of existence as if he were no
more than the flame of his useless lantern. A
cruel sense of pain oppressed his thoughts. Each
second of recollection seemed to cover the ground
of years. The dull, heavy jolting of the slow-coming
cars shook the ground. He twisted and
writhed this way and that and cried out, knowing
there were none to hear him: the wind swept
away his appeal upon its heedless wings; the nearest
car was almost upon him. Then a strange
feeling of calm came over him. He felt that
death was knocking at his heart. Hope had gone,
and his lips were only moving in prayer, when a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
light flashed out of the darkness at his very side
and he felt himself seized as if by a giant and
wrenched away from where he stood and through
the air.</p>
<p>He heard a quick exclamation, saw a lighted
lantern fall to the ground, felt a stinging pain in
his right foot, and knew no more.</p>
<p>When he recovered consciousness, three lanterns
shone in his eyes. He was lying in the mud near
the switch with the engine crew standing over
him. One of the men knelt at his side and he saw
the thin, strong features of a face he had seen
among the railroad men, but one that he knew
then he was never to forget&ndash;&ndash;the face of the yardmaster,
Callahan. Callahan knelt in the storm
with a good-natured expression. The men about
the yardmaster were less kindly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you, tar heels?&#8221; demanded the engineman
angrily.</p>
<p>Resentment, which would have been quick in
the operator a little earlier, had died in the few
moments in which he had faced death. He answered
only in the quietest way:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I am the night operator.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The deuce you are!&#8221; exclaimed the man bending
over him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; demanded the operator, in
turn.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Callahan, the night yardmaster.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have an order for you to send a car of spikes
on No. 7, Callahan. I was trying to find you
when I got caught in the frog.&#8221; The pain in his
foot overcame Bucks as he spoke. Another dread
was in his mind and he framed a question to
which he dreaded to hear the answer. &#8220;Is my
foot gone?&#8221; he faltered.</p>
<p>The yardmaster hesitated a moment and turned
to an older man at his side wearing a heavy cap.
&#8220;How about it, doctor?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>Doctor Arnold, the railway surgeon, a kindly
but stern man, answered briefly, &#8220;We won&#8217;t take
it off this time. But if he is that careless again
we will take his head off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How old are you, boy?&#8221; demanded Callahan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seventeen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, your foot isn&#8217;t hurt,&#8221; he continued
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
gruffly. &#8220;But it&#8217;s only God&#8217;s mercy that I
got here in time to pull you out of the frog.&#8221;</p>
<p>The operator was already up. &#8220;I hope I shan&#8217;t
forget it,&#8221; he said, putting out his hand. &#8220;Will
you remember the spikes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; responded Callahan grimly. &#8220;And I
guess&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say it,&#8221; said the operator gamely, as the
yardmaster hesitated.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you will.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>
<p>Bucks, after his eventful first night on duty,
slept so heavily that on the following afternoon he
had only time to eat his supper, walk haltingly up
the main street of Medicine Bend and back to
the square, when it was time to relieve the day
man at the station.</p>
<p>But the few minutes in the narrow business
street filled him with interest and at times with
astonishment. Medicine Bend, still very young,
was a mushroom railroad town of frame store
buildings hastily thrown together, and houses,
shanties, and tents. It was already the largest
and most important town between the mountains
and the Missouri River. The Union Pacific Railroad,
now a double-tracked, transcontinental highway,
laid with ninety and one hundred pound steel
rails, and ballasted with disintegrated granite,
a model of railroad construction, equipment, and
maintenance, was, after the close of the Civil War,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
being pushed with light iron rails and heavy
gradients across what was then known to geographers
as the Great American Desert, and the project
of a transcontinental railroad was meant at
that time to unite the chief port of the Pacific
coast, San Francisco, with the leading cities of the
Atlantic seaboard.</p>
<p>A railroad in building across a country considers
first the two uttermost cities (its principal
terminals), or those two portions of the country
which it seeks to connect for the interchange of
traffic.</p>
<p>The Union Pacific and its companion road, the
Central Pacific, afforded, too, the first and last instance
of the United States Government&#8217;s becoming
responsible for the building of a railroad. Although
the project of aiding a railroad to be built
somewhere between and connecting the Atlantic
and Pacific Ocean ports had been discussed by
Congress for thirty years before the fall of Fort
Sumter, the extraordinary feeling caused by the
Civil War alone made possible so unusual an undertaking.
President Lincoln himself had given
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
the subject careful thought, and when, after much
controversy and discouraging political intrigue,
the Union and Central Pacific Railroad bills were
ready to pass Congress, Abraham Lincoln was appealed
to to decide a long-standing controversy
concerning the gauge, or width of track, for the
new lines.</p>
<p>After painstaking consideration, he decided on
a gauge of five feet, but the promoters of the line
then persuaded Congress to reduce the figures to
four feet eight and one-half inches, and that
gauge is now the standard gauge for all American
railroads. It would have been better if the
railroad builders had followed Lincoln&#8217;s suggestion,
since the traffic of American railroads has
outgrown the possibilities of their gauges. And
within a few years one of the greatest of present-day
railroad builders has declared with emphasis
that a six-foot gauge must one day come to provide
our railroads with the necessary facilities for
handling the enormous and constantly expanding
volume of American railroad traffic.</p>
<p>The young operator, who, in spite of his efforts
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
to conceal his hurt, now limped a little as he
walked up the street of the new railroad town
might well look with curiosity and amazement on
what he saw. The street he walked in was no
more than a long assemblage of saloons, restaurants,
boarding-houses, gambling-houses, dance-halls
and shops. Nearer the station and fronting
on the open square, there were barber-shops
and so-called hotels. Up and down the side
streets he saw livery-stables and roughly built
warehouses for contractors&#8217; supplies, army supplies,
and stage-line depots.</p>
<p>The main street was alive with strange-looking
frontiersmen, trappers, hunters, scouts, soldiers,
settlers, railroad laborers, outlaws, prospectors,
and miners. Every face that Bucks looked into
presented a study. They were sometimes faces
bronzed with the clear, dry sunshine of the plains
and mountains, rugged with adventure and keen
with dangers met and passed, but others were furrowed
with dissipation and seamed with vice, or
merely vacant with the curiosity of the wanderer.</p>
<p>Nearly every man carried a fire-arm of some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
sort. Indians were a continual menace upon the
frontier to the north and west and on the front
where the road was being built; and in the train-service
and construction work railroad men usually
went armed. Moreover, when the frontiersmen
were not arming against the Indians they
were arming against one another; it being difficult
at times to tell whether the white men or
the savages were the more dangerous to the
peaceful pursuit of happiness. As Bucks, returning
down Front Street, neared the square that
opened before the station a group of army
officers were walking across it. They were the
first regular officers he had ever seen and he
regarded them with interest. At the station the
chief despatcher, Baxter, met him at the door.
&#8220;Bucks, I&#8217;ve been waiting for you. Can you
ride a horse?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucks smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Colonel Stanley,&#8221; continued Baxter, &#8220;is going
to the front to-night. He wants to take an operator
with him. Giddings isn&#8217;t well enough to go,
but he can take your key to-night; you can go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
with the colonel instead. He will take Dancing
and a detail of cavalrymen with Leon Sublette
and Bob Scott for guides.&#8221;</p>
<p>The suddenness of the call was not unpleasant.
It was such continual excitement and new adventure
that Bucks liked and he said he was ready.
The despatcher told him to hunt up Bill Dancing,
who would give him the details.</p>
<p>Within an hour the cavalry horses were being
loaded into a box-car up at the stock chute, and
while Bucks and big Bill Dancing watched them
an engine and the chief engineer&#8217;s car were backed
down the yard to make up the special train. At
the same moment, the two saw Stanley walking
across the yard with two engineers who were
going to the front with him.</p>
<p>Bucks looked with admiration at the soldier-constructionist.
He was slight in figure, wore the
precise-looking military cap, and was dressed with
extreme care. He stepped with a light briskness
that implied an abundance of native energy, and
his manner as he greeted the two railroad men
was intimate and gracious, putting them at once
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
at their ease. His smooth-shaven face, bronzed
with service, and his brown eyes, were alive
every moment. Whatever the enterprise, Stanley
could call forth the loyalty and the best in those
under him, and in Dancing and Scott he had two
men that worked well together and had in their
chief the unquestioning faith that insures devotion.</p>
<p>To these two more experienced men was now
to be added a third, Bucks. The train started
almost at once, and Oliver, the colonel&#8217;s cook,
prepared supper in his box-like kitchen and
chopped his potatoes, for frying, in muffled ragtime,
as the puffing engine slowly drew the train
up the long gorge into the mountains. Bucks sat
down at table with the engineers and Stanley
asked him many questions. He wanted to know
where Bucks had gone to school, why he had
quitted at fifteen, and what had brought him
away out on the Desert to begin railroading.</p>
<p>When it appeared that Stanley as well as he
himself was from Pittsburgh, and even that Bucks
had been named after the distinguished officer&ndash;&ndash;John
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
Stanley Bucks&ndash;&ndash;Bucks was happier than at
any time since he had left home.</p>
<p>The talk went on till very late. Stanley and
General Park, who also had been a regular-army
man, told stories of the Civil War, just then ended,
and the giant lineman, Dancing, entertained the
company with stories of adventure incurred in
the mountains and on the plains in building the
first transcontinental telegraph line.</p>
<p>Bucks sat for hours in silence while the three
men talked; but he had good ears and was a close
listener. All the adventure books of his boyhood
reading had been bound up with this very country
and with these rugged mountains through
which they were riding. The tales of the
people all about him during his youth had been
of the far and mysterious West&ndash;&ndash;of the overland
trail and the gold seekers, of Pike&#8217;s Peak and
California, of buffaloes and trappers and Indians,
and of the Mormons and the Great Salt Lake.
These had been his day-dreams, and at last he
was breathing the very air of them and listening
to men who had actually lived them.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></div>
<p>The sleeping-bunks in the car could hardly
be called berths, but they served to lessen the
fatigues of the night, and when Bucks woke in
the morning he saw from his window a vast
stretch of rough, desert country bordered by distant
mountain peaks, some black, some brown,
some snow-capped in the morning sun. The train
stopped in a construction camp, near the end
of the rails, and after a hasty breakfast Bucks
walked with the engineers up the track to the
head-quarters of the rail-laying gang.</p>
<p>The air was frosty. During the night snow had
fallen, and as Bucks followed his party the sun
burst over the plain that they had crossed in the
night and lighted the busy camp with a flood of
gold. It was a camp such as few American boys
had ever seen and of a type that no boy will ever
see again. Everywhere along the cuts and hillsides
and in sheltered spots the men had made
temporary quarters by burrowing into the clay or
soft rock and making dugouts and canvas-roofed
huts, with earthen sides for walls.</p>
<p>But not all were so enterprising as this. Some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
laborers were camping in old hogsheads. Even
packing-boxes served others for shelter, but were
all so disposed within the cuts and among the
ridges of the railroad grade as to be safe from Indian
forays. And along the completed railroad, all
the way from the Missouri River, material and
supply trains were moving to supply this noisy,
helter-skelter camp, which seemed to Bucks all
confusion, yet was in reality all energy.</p>
<p>General Jack Casement, in charge, came forward
to greet Stanley.</p>
<p>&#8220;And they tell me, general,&#8221; said Stanley, &#8220;you
are laying a mile a day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you would give us the ties, colonel,&#8221; returned
Casement, short-bearded and energetic,
&#8220;we should be laying two miles a day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have turned the Missouri River country upside
down for timber,&#8221; returned Stanley. &#8220;The
trouble is to get the material forward over a
single track so many hundred miles. However,
we shall be getting ties down the Spider Water
within two weeks. I am on my way up there
now to see what the contractors are doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the first intimation Bucks had had as to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
the object of the trip. Casement had a number
of subjects to lay before his superior while within
consulting distance, and Bob Scott, an hour later,
announced that Stanley would not move on for
two days. This left his attendants free, and when
Scott, low-voiced and good-natured, asked Bucks
if he wanted to go out on the Sweet Grass Plains
with him after an antelope, Bucks accepted
eagerly. The two saddled horses and Bucks,
with a rifle borrowed from Sublette, followed
Scott across a low-lying range of hills broken by
huge stone crags and studded with wind-blown
and stunted cedars, out upon the far-reaching
expanse of an open plain. The scene was inspiring,
but impressions crowded so fast one
upon another that the boy from the Alleghanies
could realize only that he was filled with sensations
of delight as his wiry buckskin clattered
furiously along the faint trail that carried him
and his guide to the north and west. The sun
was high when Scott reined up and, dismounting,
tethered his horse in a glade hidden by a grove of
aspens and bade Bucks do the same.</p>
<p>&#8220;Getting hungry?&#8221; asked Scott, smiling at his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
companion. An answer was written pretty plainly
on Bucks&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t bring anything to eat, did you?&#8221; suggested
Scott.</p>
<p>Bucks looked blank. &#8220;I never thought of it,&#8221;
he exclaimed. &#8220;Did you bring anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing but this,&#8221; answered Scott, holding up
a small buckskin sack fitted with drawing strings.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is that, Bob?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is what I carry wherever I ride. I carry
nothing else. And it is only a little bag of salt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A bag of salt!&#8221; cried Bucks. &#8220;Do you eat
salt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait and see,&#8221; answered the scout. &#8220;Pull
your belt up a notch. We&#8217;ve got a little walking
to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott, though of Chippewa blood, had been captured
when a boy by the Sioux and, adopted into
the tribe, had lived with them for years. He knew
the mountains better than any man that served
Stanley, and the latter trusted him implicitly&ndash;&ndash;nor
was the confidence ever betrayed.</p>
<p>Walking rapidly over a low-lying divide beyond
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
which lay a broad valley marking the course
of a shallow creek, Scott paused behind a clump
of cedars to scan the country. He expected to
find antelope along the creek, but could see none
in any direction. Half a mile more of scouting
explained the absence of game, and Scott pointed
out to Bucks the trail of an Indian hunting party
that had passed up the valley in the morning.
They were Cheyennes, Scott told his companion,
three warriors and two squaws&ndash;&ndash;reading the information
from signs that were as plain to him
as print&ndash;&ndash;though Bucks understood nothing of it.
In the circumstances there was nothing for it but
a fresh venture, and, remounting, the Indian led
the boy ten miles farther north to where the
plains stretched in a succession of magnificent
plateaus, toward the Sleepy Cat Mountains.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are in real Sioux country now,&#8221; observed
Scott, as he again dismounted. &#8220;And we are as
likely now to uncover a war party as a herd of
antelope.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What should you do, Bob, if we met Sioux?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Run,&#8221; smiled Bob, with Indian terseness. Yet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
somehow the boy felt that Bob, in spite of what he
said, would not run, and he realized for a moment
the apprehension of one but newly arrived on the
frontier, and still subject to tremors for his scalp.
The scout took his stand near a thicket of quaking
asp and almost at once sighted a band of antelope.
Taking Bucks, he worked around the wind
toward the band, and directed him how and when
to shoot if he got a chance. Bucks, highly wrought
up after the long crawl to get within range, did
get a chance, and with his heart beating like a
trip-hammer, covered a buck and fired. The scout
shot immediately afterward, and the herd broke
swiftly for the timber along the creek. But Bucks,
as well as his experienced companion, had brought
down an antelope.</p>
<p>Scott, as he joined his companion, looked at him
with curiosity. &#8220;Where did you learn to shoot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t do it again, Bob,&#8221; exclaimed Bucks
frankly. &#8220;The only shooting I&#8217;ve ever done is
rabbit-shooting, or squirrel-shooting. I was lucky
for once, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope your luck stays with us. If it does
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
we may get back with all of our hair,&#8221; returned
Scott. &#8220;The thing to do now is to lose
no time in leaving here. We are farther from
camp than we ought to be. When I get to running
antelope I am apt to go as far as they do.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two hunters got the carcasses across their
horses, and acting on Scott&#8217;s admonition started
to cover a good bit of the distance toward camp
before stopping.</p>
<p>The sun was already low in the west and Bucks
realized that they had been out all day. The
hunters rode due southeast, to put every mile
possible between them and the Indian country
before dark. They were riding along in this manner
at dusk, when Scott, leading, pointed to a
canyon that offered a hiding-place for the night,
and directed his horse into it. Scarcely had the
two passed within the canyon walls when Scott
halted and, with a quick, low command to the
boy, sprang from his horse. Bucks lost no time
in following suit: they had ridden almost into an
Indian camp, and when Bucks&#8217;s feet touched the
ground Scott was covering with his rifle a Sioux
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
brave who with two squaws rose out of the darkness
before him. Quick words passed between
Scott and the Indian in the Sioux tongue. Bucks&#8217;s
hair rose on end until the confab quieted, and
the scout&#8217;s rifle came down. In an instant it was
all over, but in that instant the Easterner had
lived years.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is all right,&#8221; said Bob, turning to reassure
his charge. &#8220;He is a young chief&ndash;&ndash;Iron Hand.
I know his father. These three are alone. Eight
of them went out after buffalo five days ago. The
second day they fell in with Turkey Leg and a
Cheyenne war party. Two of Iron Hand&#8217;s warriors
were killed. The rest got separated and
these three lost their horses. Iron Hand,&#8221; Scott
nodded toward the silent Indian, &#8220;was hit in the
arm, and with his squaw and her sister has been
trying to get north, hiding by day and travelling
by night. He can&#8217;t shoot his rifle; he thinks his
arm is broken; and the squaws haven&#8217;t been able
to kill anything. They are hungry, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And did they tell you all this in those few
words?&#8221; demanded Bucks incredulously.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t take many words to tell stories in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
this country. If a man talked much he would
be dead and buried before he got through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bob, if they are hungry, give them some antelope.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott, who had meant to suggest the same thing,
was pleased that the offer should come from his
companion, and so told the wounded Indian. The
latter drew himself up with dignity and spoke a
few rapid words. &#8220;He says he is glad,&#8221; translated
Bob, &#8220;that your heart is big. And that it will be
safer to go farther into the canyon. The Cheyennes
are hunting for them all around here, and if
you are not afraid to camp with the Sioux, we
will stay with them here to-night. While the
Cheyennes are hunting them, they might find us.
It will be about the safest thing we can do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know best,&#8221; said his companion. &#8220;Can
you trust this man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trust him?&#8221; echoed Bob mildly. &#8220;I wish I
could trust the word of a white man half as far
as I can that of a Sioux. He understands everything
you say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can he talk English?&#8221; asked Bucks in surprise.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Better than I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was with queer sensations that Bucks found
himself in a hostile country and with the deadliest
enemies of the white man going into camp for
the night. Within a minute or two after Scott
and the wounded brave had picked a defended
camp near a rivulet of water, the two squaws had
a fire going, and they set to work at once dressing
an antelope.</p>
<p>Savory morsels were cut from choice spots on
the carcasses and these were broiled by impaling
them on long sticks over the fire. Bucks, learning
very fast with his eyes, saw how surprisingly
small an affair an Indian camp-fire is, and how
much could be done with a few buffalo chips, if
one understood how to keep them renewed. Both
safety and convenience were served by the tiny
blaze, and meat never tasted as good to Bucks as
it did on that clear, frosty night, broiled by the
two women and garnished from Bob Scott&#8217;s provident
salt bag.</p>
<p>After satisfying his ravenous hunger, which the
Indians considered not even a fair appetite, Bucks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
asked to look at the warrior&#8217;s injured arm, explaining
that his father had been an army surgeon
in the great white man&#8217;s war, as Bob Scott
designated the Civil War in translating for the
Sioux. The arm, which was badly swollen, he
found had indeed been broken by a bullet near
the wrist, but only one bone was fractured, and,
finding no trace of the bullet, the confident young
surgeon offered to set the fracture.</p>
<p>Iron Hand, nothing loath, accepted the offer,
and after cleansing the wound as well as it could
be cleansed in running water hard by, Bucks took
the rough splints handily supplied by Scott&#8217;s hunting-knife,
and pulling the bone into place with
the scout&#8217;s aid&ndash;&ndash;though the brave winced a little
at the crude surgery&ndash;&ndash;he soon had the forearm
set and was rewarded with a single guttural,
&#8220;Wa-sha-ta-la!&#8221; from the stalwart warrior, which,
Bob explained, meant, &#8220;Heap good.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sitting afterward by the camp-fire, Scott and
Iron Hand, since the young chief would not talk
English, conversed in the Sioux tongue, the
scout translating freely for his younger companion,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
while the squaws dressed the second
antelope and cut it up for convenience in carrying
on the horses to Casement&#8217;s camp. Scott
reserved only the hind-quarters of each animal
for himself and Bucks, giving the rest to their
hosts.</p>
<p>When it was late, Scott showed the boy how to
pillow his head on his saddle and then stretched
himself out to sleep. Bucks lay a long time looking
up at the stars. When he fell asleep, he woke
again very soon. His companion was sleeping
peacefully beside him, and he saw Iron Hand
sitting by the fire. Bucks easily imagined his
arm would keep him awake. The squaws were
still broiling pieces of antelope over the little
blaze, which was neither bigger nor smaller than
before, and together with the chief they were
still eating. Bucks slumbered and woke again
and again during the night, but always to see
the same thing&ndash;&ndash;the three Indians sitting about
the fire, broiling and eating the welcome and
wholly unexpected venison.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>
<p>Before daybreak the scout roused his companion,
and, after breakfast with the three Sioux,
who, according to Bob, were still eating supper,
the two hunters left their chance companions in
the canyon, rode rapidly south, and, with their
antelope haunches as trophies, reached Casement&#8217;s
camp about ten o&#8217;clock.</p>
<p>Stanley, who was conferring with Casement,
came out of the tent greatly amazed at his scout&#8217;s
venturing so far on a hunt as to expose himself
and his companion to danger.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were safe every minute, colonel,&#8221; declared
Scott.</p>
<p>&#8220;Safe?&#8221; echoed Stanley incredulously. &#8220;No
man is safe, Bob, a mile from the track-layers.
The Sioux killed and scalped one of our engineers
not ten miles from here, when we were running
this very line last winter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This lad,&#8221; nodded Scott, &#8220;is as good a shot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
as I am. He brought down the first antelope.
We get along with the Sioux all right, too, don&#8217;t
we, Bucks?&#8221; he demanded, appealing to his fellow-hunter.
&#8220;We ate supper with them last night,&#8221;
he added to mystify his listeners, &#8220;and camped
with Iron Hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even General Casement stared at this and
waited to hear Scott tell Stanley the story of
their night&#8217;s adventure. &#8220;However, colonel,&#8221;
concluded Scott, &#8220;there is a war party of Cheyennes
near here. It is a good time to be careful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Bob,&#8221; retorted Stanley, looking at
his scout keenly, though no one could be angry
at Scott long. &#8220;You set the example.&#8221;</p>
<p>The words were hardly out of his mouth
when an operator came running down the track
from the telegraph tent with a message for
General Casement. It contained word from the
operator at Peace River that section men reported
a war party of Indians, crossing the railroad near
Feather Creek, had attacked an emigrant party
camped there.</p>
<p>In an instant the whole construction camp had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
the news and the work was thrown into confusion.
Feather Creek was twenty miles away. Orders
flew fast. A special train was made up, and
Stanley taking command, with Casement to aid,
made ready instantly to leave for the scene of
the disaster.</p>
<p>The men running from the grade fell into line
like veteran soldiers. Indeed, most of them had
seen service in the war just closed and the smell
of powder was no novelty. Bob Scott turned the
venison over to Oliver and loaded his horse in
the car with those of the cavalrymen. Under
Stanley&#8217;s orders he himself rode as pilot in the
cab with the engine crew. Bucks also reported to
Stanley, and within twenty minutes the relief train
carrying two hundred men was plunging down
the long hill toward Feather Creek. Heads were
craned out of the car windows, and in rounding
every curve Bucks, with the scout Leon Sublette,
sitting greatly wrought up behind Stanley and
Casement, expected momentarily to see Cheyenne
war bonnets spring up out of the stunted cedars
that lined the hills along the right of way.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></div>
<p>But not a sign could be seen of any living
thing. The train reached Feather Creek, and
slowly crossed the bridge before Scott signalled
the engineman to stop. His eye had detected the
scene of the fight, and the ground beyond&ndash;&ndash;a low
cut&ndash;&ndash;was favorable for getting the men safely out
of the cars.</p>
<p>As the engine slowed, a little scene of desolation
beside the right of way met Bucks&#8217;s eye,
and he caught sight of the ghastly battle-field.
A frightened section crew emerged from the wild-plum
thickets along the creek bottom, as the
cavalrymen, followed by Casement&#8217;s armed men,
poured out of the three cars. Stanley with his
scouts led the way to the emigrant camp, where
the fight had taken place. The wagons had been
burned, the horses run off, and the three unfortunate
men butchered.</p>
<p>Bucks experienced a shock when Scott came
upon the three dead men whose mutilated bodies
had been dragged from the scene by the section
men and who lay with covered faces side by side
under a little plum-tree, fragrant with blossoms
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
and alive with the hum of bees. The sunshine
and the beauty of the spot contrasted strangely
with the revolting spectacle upon the grass.</p>
<p>Stanley gave the orders by which the bodies
were conveyed to the train and with the scouts
and cavalrymen reconnoitering the surrounding
country, Casement&#8217;s men lay on their arms in
the shade of the cut. Dancing rigged a pony instrument
to the telegraph wires, which had not
been disturbed, and Bucks transmitted messages
to Fort Kearney advising the commanding officer
of the murders and adding afterward the report
of Scott and Sublette as to the direction the
marauders had taken in flight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who were the beasts, Bob, that could treat
men like that?&#8221; demanded Bucks in an angry
undertone, when he had clicked the messages over
the wires.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bad Indians,&#8221; answered Scott sententiously.
&#8220;You have that kind of white men, don&#8217;t you?
These fellows are probably Turkey Leg&#8217;s thieving
Cheyennes. We shall hear more of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime the scouts and the cavalry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
detail rode out again trying to unmask the Cheyennes,
but without success. It was a week before
they were even heard of, and after an all-day
attempt to do something, the train backed up to
camp and work was resumed as if nothing had
happened.</p>
<p>After waiting a few days, Stanley, always
restive under idleness, determined to push on
across the Sweet Grass country with horses, to
learn how the timber cutters on the river were
faring with their slender military guard. The
party, consisting of the detail of ten men and the
two scouts and Bucks, started one morning at
sunrise and made their way without molestation
into the little-known mountain range called then,
as far south as Colorado, the Black Hills.</p>
<p>Stanley explained to Bucks during the morning
how the chief engineering difficulty of the
whole transcontinental line confronted the engineers
right where they were now riding. Here
the mountains were thrown abruptly above the
plain to a great height and the locating engineers
were still at their wits&#8217; ends to know how to climb
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
the tremendous ascent with practicable grades.
Stanley became so interested in studying the
country during the day, as the difficulties of the
problem presented themselves afresh to him, that
the party made slow progress. Camp was pitched
early in the afternoon under a ridge that offered
some natural features for defence. Here the cavalrymen
were left, and Stanley, taking Scott, started
out after some venison for supper. Bucks stood by,
looking eager as the two made ready for the hunt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along if you like,&#8221; said Stanley at length.
&#8220;You won&#8217;t be happy, Bucks, till you get lost
somewhere in this country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sublette lent Bucks a rifle, and the three men
set out together, riding rapidly into the rough
hills to the northwest. Scott covered the ground
fast, but he searched in vain for sign of antelope.
&#8220;Indians have been all over this divide,&#8221; he announced
after much hard riding and a failure to
find any game. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t look like venison for
supper to-night, colonel. Stop!&#8221; he added suddenly.</p>
<p>His companions, surprised by the tone of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
last word, halted. Leaning over his pony&#8217;s neck
the scout was reading the rocky soil. He dismounted,
and walking on, leading his horse, he
inspected, very carefully, the ground toward a
dry creek bed opening to the east.</p>
<p>He was gone perhaps five minutes. &#8220;Colonel,&#8221;
he said, smiling reassuringly, when he returned,
&#8220;this is no place for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indians,&#8221; said Stanley tersely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cheyennes. Back to camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Down the creek?&#8221; suggested Stanley.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bottom is alive with Indians.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Up then, Bob?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Their camp is just above the bend. They
have spotted our trail, too, somehow. It may
be they are riding easy to close in on us,&#8221; smiled
Scott, while Bucks&#8217;s hair began to pull. &#8220;Our
way out is over this divide.&#8221; He indicated the
rough country east of the creek as he spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Divide!&#8221; exclaimed Stanley, looking up at the
practically sheer walls of rock that hedged the
course of the creek. &#8220;We can&#8217;t climb those hills,
if we never get out.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></div>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re not quite so bad as they look. Anyway,
colonel, we&#8217;ve got to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They can pick us off our horses like monkeys
all the way up!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a chance for our scalps, colonel. And it
will be as hard riding for them as it is for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stanley looked at Bucks with perplexity. &#8220;This
boy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can make it, Colonel Stanley,&#8221; exclaimed
Bucks, who felt he must say something.</p>
<p>Stanley still hesitated.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve no time to lose,&#8221; smiled Scott significantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then go ahead, Bob.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had half a mile of comparatively level
ground to cross before they began their climb,
and this strip they rode very hard. When they
reached the hills, Scott headed for a forbidding-looking
canyon and urged his horse without ceasing
through the rocky wash that strewed its floor.
Stanley, with an excellent mount, could have kept
well up, but he had put Bucks ahead of him in
the safe place of the little procession, and the boy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
had difficulty in keeping within call of their active
leader. The minute they were out of sight
of the creek bottoms, Scott, choosing an apparently
unscalable ascent, urged his horse up one of
the canyon walls and the three were soon climbing
in order.</p>
<p>Happily, Bucks&#8217;s scrub horse gave a better account
of himself in climbing than he had done in
covering better ground. As their horses stumbled
hurriedly along the narrow ledges, they made noise
enough to wake the Indian dead and the loose
rock tumbled with sinister echoes down the canyon
wall. But progress was made, and the white
men felt only anxious lest pursuit should catch
them exposed on the uncovered height up which
they were fast clambering.</p>
<p>Secure in their escape, the three were nearing
the coveted top when a yell echoed through the
canyon from below. There was no mistaking
such a yell. Bucks, who had never heard anything
so ferocious, had no need to be told what it was&ndash;&ndash;it,
so to say, introduced itself. And it was answered
by another yell, more formidable still, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
again by a chorus of yells. Then it seemed to
Bucks&#8217;s unaccustomed ears as if a thousand
lusty throats were opened, and scared rigid he
looked behind him and saw the canyon below
alive with warriors.</p>
<p>They were riding helter-skelter to reach a range
where they could pick the fugitives off the crest
of the canyon side. Within a minute, almost,
their rifles were cracking. Scott had already
reached a point of concealment, and above the
heads of Bucks and Stanley fired his rifle in
answer. An Indian brave, riding furiously to a
rock that would have commanded Stanley and
Bucks as they urged their horses on, started in his
saddle as Scott fired and clutched his side instantly
with his rifle hand. His pony bolted as
the half-hitch of the rawhide thong on its lower
jaw was loosened and the rider, toppling, fell
heavily backward to the ground. The riderless
horse dashed on. The yelling Indians had had
their blunt warning and now scurried for cover.
The interval, short as it was, gave Bucks and
Stanley a chance.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></div>
<p>Spurring relentlessly and crouching low on their
horses&#8217; necks, they made a dash across the exposed
wall of rock near the top, that lay between them
and safety. A renewed yell echoed the rage and
chagrin of their pursuers, and a quick fire of scattering
shots followed their rapid flight, but the
Indians were confused, and Bucks, followed by his
soldier champion, flung himself from his saddle in
the clump of cedars behind which Scott, safely
hidden, was reloading his rifle. Choosing his opportunity
carefully, Stanley fired at once at an
exposed brave and succeeded in disabling him.
Bucks was forbidden to shoot and told to hold
his rifle, if it were needed, in readiness for his companions.
With the bullets cutting the twigs above
their heads, Stanley and Scott held a council of
war. Scott insisted on remaining behind to check
their pursuers where they were, while the two with
him rode on to safety.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can hold this bunch, colonel,&#8221; declared Scott
briefly. &#8220;There may not be a second chance as
good. Get on with the boy before another party
cuts you off. They can cross below us and save
two or three miles. Get away.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></div>
<p>&#8220;But how will you get away?&#8221; demanded Bucks.</p>
<p>Stanley laughed. &#8220;Never mind Bob. He
could crawl through a Cheyenne village with a
camp-fire on his back. It&#8217;s what to do with you,
Bucks, that bothers us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just you get on, colonel,&#8221; urged Bob. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
manage all right. Leave your horse,&#8221; he added,
turning to Bucks, &#8220;and you take mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucks protested and refused to leave Scott with
an inferior mount, but his protests were of no
avail. He was curtly directed by Stanley to do as
he was told, and unwillingly he turned his horse
over to Scott and took the scout&#8217;s better steed.
Scott added hurried and explicit directions to
Stanley as to the course to follow back to camp,
and without loss of time Stanley and Bucks
crouching behind friendly rocks led their horses
up the inner canyon wall and, remounting at the
top, galloped hurriedly down a long ridge.</p>
<p>At intervals, shots from the Indians reached
their ears, and long-drawn yells, followed by the
sharper crack of Scott&#8217;s rifle, echoed from the
west as the scout held the wall against the enemy.
Bucks did not understand the real danger that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
the scout feared for his party. It was that
other parties of the marauding Cheyennes might,
by following the creek, gain the divide in time to
cut off the railroad men from their line of escape.
The sounds of the stubborn contest behind them
died away as their straining horses gradually
put miles between them and the enemy. The
fugitives had reached the summit of the hills and
with a feeling of safety were easing their pace
when Bucks discerned, almost directly ahead of
them, dark objects moving slowly along the foot
of a wooded hill. The two men halted.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
<a name='CHAPTER_V' id='CHAPTER_V'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Indians,&#8221; announced Stanley after a brief
moment of inspection.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are cut off,&#8221; he added, looking alertly over
the landscape about them. &#8220;This way, Bucks.
Ride as low as you can.&#8221; Without further
words he made an abrupt turn to the right,
striking south to get behind a friendly butte
that rose half a mile away.</p>
<p>&#8220;The question now is,&#8221; said Stanley, as they
held their horses up a little after getting somewhat
farther out of sight, &#8220;whether they have
likewise seen us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The harried pair were not long in doubt. They
had hardly changed their course when there was
immediate activity on the hill-side. The railroad
men spurred on; the distant horsemen, now on
their flank, dashed out upon the broad slope that
lay between the two parties and rode straight
and hard after the fleeing men. Stanley steadied
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
his inexperienced companion as the latter urged
his horse. &#8220;Not too hard just now. Your pony
will need all his wind. It&#8217;s a question of getting
away with our scalps and we must be careful.
Follow me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucks&#8217;s heart, as he looked back, crowded up into
his throat. A long skirmish line of warriors had
spread across the unbroken plateau to the east,
and Stanley, with nothing but instinct for a guide,
was making at top speed to the south to get away
from them.</p>
<p>As the two dashed on, they found to their consternation
that the country was growing smoother
and affording fewer hiding-places from the sharp
eyes behind them. Stanley knew they must either
ride through the hills ahead or perish. He sought
vainly for some break in the great black wall of
low-lying mountains toward which they were riding,
yet from what he knew of the country he
hardly dared hope for one.</p>
<p>He had reconnoitred these hills time after time
when running the railroad lines and knew pretty
well where he was. The pursuers, too, apparently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
sure of their prey, rode hard, gradually lessening
the distance that separated them from the wary
soldier and his companion. The Indians had
ceased yelling now. It was beyond that. But
even in his excitement and fear the inexperienced
boy could not but admire the composure and
daring of his companion.</p>
<p>As Stanley glanced now and again back at his
enraged enemies he was every inch a soldier. And
he watched the distance between the Cheyennes
and himself as coolly as if calculating a mere problem
in geometry. While saving every possible
breath for his horses, he yet managed to keep the
Cheyennes at a distance. The Indians, bent on
overhauling the fleeing men before they could
reach even the scant protection of the scattered
timber they were now approaching, redoubled
their efforts to cut off the escape.</p>
<p>Forced by the desperation of his circumstances,
Stanley bent more and more to the west of south,
even though in doing so he seemed to be getting
into a more hopeless country. The veteran campaigner
eyed Bucks&#8217;s horse carefully as he turned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
in his saddle, but Scott&#8217;s wiry beast appeared
quite fresh, and Stanley, turning his eyes, again
swept the horizon for a friendly break in the black
walls ahead. As he did so he was startled to
see, directly in front, Indians riding at full speed
out of the hills he was heading for. He reined his
galloping horse and turned straight into the west.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bucks,&#8221; he exclaimed, looking with concern
at the rider now by his side, &#8220;it&#8217;s a case of
obey orders now. If I stop at any time, you ride
straight on&ndash;&ndash;do you understand? You&#8217;ve got a
revolver?&#8221; Bucks tapped the big Colt at his
side. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let them take you alive. And hold
your last shot till a buck rides in for your scalp.&#8221;</p>
<p>The straining horses seemed to understand the
sharp words that passed from saddle to saddle.
The Indians were already within gunshot, but
too sure of their game to lose any time in
shooting; nor was Stanley willing to waste a shot
upon them. As he dodged in between a broken
wall of granite and a scrubby clump of cedars,
closely followed by Bucks, their pursuers could
have picked either man from his saddle.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></div>
<p>Stanley had no longer any fixed purpose of
escape. He meant merely to dismount when he
could ride no farther and sell his life as best he
could, while Bucks took such further chance of
escape as his companion&#8217;s last stand might afford.
The hard-driven fighter was even looking for a
well-placed rock to drop behind, when the horse
plunging under him lurched to one side of the
cedars and a gulf in the walls suddenly opened
before his surprised rider.</p>
<p>A rotten ledge of burned granite seemed to
head a mountain wash directly in their path.
There was a sheer drop of twenty feet to the crumbling
slope of disintegrated stone under the head of
the draw itself, but Stanley, without looking back,
never hesitated. Urging his panting horse, he
made a flying leap down into space, and horse and
rider landed knee-deep in the soft, gravelly granite
below them.</p>
<p>Bucks&#8217;s mustang shied on the brink. He spurred
him excitedly, and the trembling beast, nerving himself,
leaped far out over the ledge, following Stanley
so closely that he almost struck him with his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
hoofs as he went flying over the engineer&#8217;s head.
Bucks rolled headlong as his horse plunged into
the loose d&eacute;bris. He scrambled to his feet and,
spitting the gravel from between his bruised lips,
caught the bridle of his horse as the latter righted
himself.</p>
<p>No legs were broken and much was already
gained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick!&#8221; cried Stanley. &#8220;Ride for your life!&#8221;
he shouted as Bucks regained his saddle. The
two spurred at the same time and dashed down
the draw at breakneck speed just as the Indians
yelling on the brink of the ledge stopped to pour
a volley after the desperate men. Unable to land
an effective shot, the Cheyennes, nothing daunted,
and hesitating only a moment, plunged over the
precipice after their quarry.</p>
<p>But they had lost their great advantage.
The dry watercourse proved unexpectedly good
riding for the fleeing railroad men. It was a
downhill run, with their hopes rising every moment.
Moreover, the draw soon turned sharply
to the south and put a big shoulder of granite
between the pursuers and the pursued. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
horses of the latter were now relieved, and the
wary Stanley, riding with some reserve speed,
held his rifle ready for a stern shot should one
become necessary. He found himself riding between
two almost perpendicular walls washed
by the same granite gravel into which they had
plunged on the start, but with the course again
turning, to his surprise, to the east. Once, Stanley
checked the flight long enough to stop and listen,
but the two heard the active Indians clattering
down the canyon after them, and rode on and
on.</p>
<p>As they could see by the lengthening shadow
on the mountain-sides far above them, the sun
was setting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cheer up,&#8221; cried Stanley, who had put his
companion ahead of him. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got the best
of them. All we need is open country.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not mention the chances of disaster,
which were that they might encounter an obstacle
that would leave them at bay before their tireless
pursuers. Mile after mile they galloped without
halting again to see whether they were being
chased. Indeed, no distance seemed too considerable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
to put between them and the active war-paint
in the saddles behind.</p>
<p>A new turn in the canyon now revealed a wide
valley opening between the hills before them. Far
below, golden in the light of the setting sun, they
saw the great eastern slope of the Black Hills
spreading out upon a beautiful plain.</p>
<p>Stanley swung his hat from his head with an
exulting cry, and Bucks, without quite understanding
why, but assuming it the right thing to do,
yelled his loudest. On and on they rode, down
a broad, spreading ridge that led without a break
from the tortuous hills behind them into the
open country far below. Stanley put full ten
miles between himself and the canyon they had
ridden out of before he checked his speed. The
Indians had completely disappeared and, disappointed
in their venture, had no doubt ridden
back to their fastnesses to wait for other unwary
white men. Stanley chose a little draw
with good water and grass, and night was just
falling as they picketed their exhausted horses and
stretched themselves, utterly used up, on the grass.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></div>
<p>&#8220;We are safe until morning, anyway,&#8221; announced
Stanley as he threw himself down. &#8220;And
this Indian chase may be the luckiest thing that
has ever happened to me in the troublesome course
of an unlucky life.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; continued the engineer,
wiping the sweat and dust from his tired
face. Bucks admitted that he did not.</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter,&#8221; returned his companion; &#8220;it isn&#8217;t
necessary now. You will sometime. But I think
I have done in the last hour something I have
been trying to do for years. Many others have
likewise failed in the same quest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucks listened with growing interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, for years,&#8221; Stanley went on, &#8220;incredible
as it may sound, I have been searching these
mountains for just such a crevice as we have
this moment ridden down. You see how this
range&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;the exhausted engineer stretched flat on
his back, but, with burning eyes, pointed to the
formidable mountain wall that rose behind them
in the dusk of the western sky&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;rises abruptly
from the plains below. Our whole grade climb
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
for the continental divide is right here, packed
into these few miles. Neither I nor any one else
has ever been able to find such a pass as we need
to get up into it. But if we have saved our
scalps, my boy, you will share with me the honor
of finding the pass for the Union Pacific Railroad
over the Rocky Mountains.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were supperless, but it was very exciting,
and Bucks was extremely happy. Stanley
watched that night until twelve. When he woke
Bucks the moon was rising and the ghostly peaks
in the west towered sentinel-like above the plains
flooded with silver. The two were to move at
one o&#8217;clock when the moon would be high enough
to make riding safe. It was cold, but fire was
forbidden.</p>
<p>The horses were grazing quietly, and Bucks, examining
his revolver, which he had all the time
felt he was wretchedly incompetent to shoot, sat
down beside Stanley, already fast asleep, to stand
his watch. He had lost Sublette&#8217;s rifle in falling
into the wash-out. At least he had found no leisure
to pick it up and save his hair in the same instant,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
and he wondered now how much he should
have to pay for the rifle.</p>
<p>When the sun rose next morning the two horsemen
were far out of the foot-hills and bearing
northeast toward camp&ndash;&ndash;so far had their ride for
life taken them from their hunting ground. They
scanned the horizon at intervals, with some anxiety,
for Indians, and again with the hope of
sighting their missing guide. Once they saw a
distant herd of buffalo, and Bucks experienced a
shock until assured by Stanley that the suspicious
objects were neither Cheyennes nor Sioux.</p>
<p>By nine o&#8217;clock they had found the transcontinental
telegraph line and had a sure trail to
follow until they discovered the grade stakes of
the railroad, and soon descried the advance-guard
of the graders busy with plough and shovel and
scraper. As they rode into camp the very first
man to emerge from Casement&#8217;s tent, with his
habitual smile, was Bob Scott.</p>
<p>Casement himself, who had heard Scott&#8217;s story
when the latter had come in at daybreak, was
awaiting Stanley&#8217;s return with anxiety, but this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
was all forgotten in the great news Stanley
brought. Sublette and Scott now returned to the
hunting camp for the cavalry detail, and, reinforced
by these, the two heroes of the long flight rode
back to reconnoitre their escape from the mountains.
Bucks rode close to Bob Scott and learned
how the scout had outwitted his assailants at the
canyon, and how after they had all ridden out
of it, he had ridden into it and retraced with
safety in the night the path that the hunters
had followed in riding into the hill country.</p>
<p>The second ride through the long defile, which
itself was now the object of so much intense
inspection, Bucks found much less exciting than
the first. The party even rode up to where the
first flying leap had been made, and to Bucks&#8217;s
joy found Sublette&#8217;s rifle still in the wash; it
had been overlooked by the Indians.</p>
<p>What surprised Bucks most was to find how
many hours it took to cover the ground that Stanley
and he had negotiated in seemingly as many
minutes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>
<p>After a week in Casement&#8217;s camp, Stanley and
his cavalrymen, accompanied by Dancing, Scott,
and Bucks, struck north and east toward the
Spider Water River to find out why the ties were
not coming down faster. Rails had already been
laid across the permanent Spider Water Bridge&ndash;&ndash;known
afterward as the first bridge, for the big
river finished more than one structure before it
was completely subdued&ndash;&ndash;and the rail-laying was
hampered only by the lack of ties.</p>
<p>The straggling bands of Cheyennes had in the
interval been driven out of the foot-hills by troops
sent against them, and Stanley and his little escort
met with no trouble on his rapid journey.</p>
<p>Toward evening of the second day a broad
valley opened on the plain before them, and in
the sunset Bucks saw, winding like a silver thread
far up toward the mountains, the great stream
about which he had already heard so much. Camp
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
was pitched on a high bluff that commanded the
valley in both directions for many miles, and
after supper Scott and Bucks rode down to the
river.</p>
<p>In its low-water stage nothing could have looked
more sluggish or more sleepily deceptive than the
mighty and treacherous stream. Scott and his
companions always gave the river the name the
Sioux had long ago given it because of its sudden,
ravening floods and its deadly traps laid for such
unwary men or animals as trusted its peaceful
promise and slept within reach of its cruel power.</p>
<p>Standing in the glow of the evening sky in this
land where the clear, bright light seemed to lift him
high above the earth, Bucks looked at the yellow
flood long and thoughtfully&ndash;&ndash;as well he might&ndash;&ndash;for
the best of his life was to be spent within
ken of its flow and to go in doing battle with it
himself, or in sending faithful men to its battling,
sometimes to perish within its merciless
currents.</p>
<p>Next morning as the party, following a trail
along the bluffs, rode up in the direction of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
contractors&#8217; camps they discerned out on the river
bottom a motley cluster of tents and shanties
pitched under a hill. A number of flatboats
lay in the backwater behind the bend and a
quantity of ties corded along the bank indicated
a loading-place, but no one seemed to be doing
any loading. The few men that could be seen in
the distance appeared to be loafing in the sunshine
along the straggling street-way that led to
the river. Stanley checked his horse.</p>
<p>&#8220;What place is that?&#8221; he demanded of Scott.</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; returned the guide, &#8220;is Sellersville.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sellersville,&#8221; echoed Stanley. &#8220;What is Sellersville?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sellersville is where they bring most of the
ties for the boats.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have they started a town down there on the
bottoms?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They have started enough saloons and gambling
dens to get the money from the men that
are chopping ties.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stanley contemplated for a moment the ill-looking
settlement. A mile farther on they encountered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
a number of men following the trail up
the river.</p>
<p>A small dog barked furiously at the Stanley
party as they came up, and acted as if he were
ready to fight every trooper in the detail. He
dashed back and forth, barking and threatening
so fiercely that every one&#8217;s attention was drawn
to him.</p>
<p>Stanley stopped the leader and found he was a
tie-camp foreman from up-river taking men to
camp. &#8220;Is that your dog?&#8221; demanded Stanley,
indicating the belligerent animal who seemed set
upon eating somebody alive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; admitted the foreman philosophically.
&#8220;He sort o&#8217; claims me, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you keep a cur like that around for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t get rid of him,&#8221; returned the foreman.
&#8220;He is no good, but the boys like his impudence.
Down, Scuffy!&#8221; he cried, looking for a stick to
throw at his pet.</p>
<p>Bucks surveyed the company of men. They
were a sorry-looking lot. The foreman explained
that he had dragged them out of the dens at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
Sellersville to go back to work. When remonstrated
with for the poor showing the contractors
were making, the foreman pointed to the plague-spot
on the bottoms.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the reason you are not getting any
ties,&#8221; said he lazily. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got five hundred
men at work up here; that is, they are supposed
to be at work. These whiskey dives and faro
joints get them the minute they are paid, and for
ten days after pay-day we can&#8217;t get a hundred
men back to camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>The foreman as he spoke looked philosophically
toward the canvas shanties below. &#8220;I spend half
my time chasing back and forth, but I can&#8217;t do
much. They hold my men until they have robbed
them, and then if they show fight they chuck them
into the river. It&#8217;s the same with the flatboat
men.&#8221; He turned, as he continued, to indicate
two particularly wretched specimens. &#8220;These fellows
were drugged and robbed of every dollar they
brought here before they got to work at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stanley likewise gazed thoughtfully upon the
cluster of tents and shacks along the river landing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
He turned after a moment to Scott. &#8220;Bob,&#8221; said
he, looking back again toward the river, &#8220;what
gang do you suppose this is?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott shook his head. &#8220;That I couldn&#8217;t say,
Colonel Stanley.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose,&#8221; continued Stanley, still regarding
the offending settlement, &#8220;you and Dancing reconnoitre
them a little and tell me who they are.
We will wait for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott and the lineman swung into their saddles
and started down the trail that led to the landing.
Stanley spoke again to the foreman. &#8220;Can
those men use an axe?&#8221; he demanded, indicating
the two men that the foreman asserted had been
robbed.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are both old choppers&ndash;&ndash;but this gang at
Sellersville stole even their axes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave these two men here with me,&#8221; directed
Stanley as he watched Scott and Dancing ride
down toward Sellersville. &#8220;I may have something
for them to chop after a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>The foreman assented. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like the
bunch,&#8221; he murmured; &#8220;but nobody at our camp
wants to tackle them. What can we do?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></div>
<p>While the foreman continued to talk, Stanley
again looked over the human wrecks that he
had rounded up and brought out of Sellersville.
&#8220;What can we do?&#8221; echoed Stanley, repeating
the last question tartly. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll tell you one
thing we can do. We can throw Sellersville into
the river.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dancing and Scott were gone half an hour. The
report, when they returned, was not encouraging.
&#8220;It is a bunch of cutthroats from Medicine
Bend, colonel,&#8221; said Bob Scott.</p>
<p>&#8220;All friends of yours, I presume, Bob,&#8221; returned
Stanley.</p>
<p>The scout only smiled. &#8220;John Rebstock is
there with his following. But the boss, I think,
is big George Seagrue. He is mean, you know.
George has got two or three men to his credit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are we enough to clean them out, Bob?&#8221;
inquired Stanley impatiently.</p>
<p>Scott looked around and his eye rested for a
moment on Dancing. He hitched his trousers.
&#8220;There&#8217;s about thirty men down there. I expect,&#8221;
he continued reflectively, &#8220;we can take
care of them if we have to.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></div>
<p>Stanley turned to the sergeant of his troopers.
&#8220;Pitch a permanent camp, sergeant. There will
be nothing to take us any farther up the river.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Stanley gave the order Bucks noticed that
Dancing winked at Scott. And without the meaning
glances exchanged by the lineman and the
scout, Bucks would have understood from Stanley&#8217;s
manner that he meant strong measures.
Stanley sent a further message to the contractor,
and the foreman, followed by his convoy of humanity,
started on. The soldiers, foreseeing a
lively scene, stripped their pack-horses and set
at work pitching their tents.</p>
<p>Leaving four men in camp, the engineer, accompanied
by his escort, rode down the bluffs and,
striking a lumber road, galloped rapidly through
the poplar bottom-lands toward the gamblers&#8217;
camp. It was an early tour for human wolves
to be stirring, and the invaders clattered into Sellersville
before they attracted any attention.</p>
<p>A bugler, however, riding into the middle of
the settlement, sounded a trumpet call, and at
the unwonted notes frowsy, ill-shaped heads appeared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
at various shanty doors and tent-flaps to
see what was doing. Stanley sent one man from
door to door to notify the inmates of each shelter
to pack up their effects and make ready to move
without delay.</p>
<p>Five troopers were detailed to guard three
gambling tents that stood together in the middle
of the camp, each of these being flanked by
smaller dens. Word was then passed to the gamblers
and saloon-keepers to line up on the river
front.</p>
<p>Stanley regarded the gathering crowd with a
cold eye. Scott, who stood near Bucks, pointed
out a square-shouldered man with a deep scar
splitting one cheek. &#8220;Do you know that fellow,
Bucks?&#8221; he asked in an undertone.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; who is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a Medicine Bend confidence man,
Perry. Do you remember the woman you helped
out with a ticket to Iowa? Perry is her husband&ndash;&ndash;the
man that Dave Hawk made pay up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perry was a type of the Sellersville crowd now
being evicted. There was much talk as the soldiers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
urged and drove the gang out of one haunt
after another and a good deal of threatening as
the leaders marched out in front of Stanley.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is running this camp?&#8221; demanded the
officer curtly. The men looked at one another.
A fat, slow-moving man with small blue eyes and
a wheezy voice answered: &#8220;Why, no one in particular,
colonel. We&#8217;re just a-camping in a bunch.
What&#8217;s a-matter? Seagrue here,&#8221; he nodded to a
sharp-jawed companion, &#8220;and Perry,&#8221; he added,
jerking his thumb toward the scarred-faced man,
&#8220;and me own these two big tents in partners.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My name&#8217;s Rebstock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Produce the axes stolen here from these two
men,&#8221; said Stanley, indicating the choppers behind
him. There was a jangle of talk between
Rebstock and his associates, and Perry, much
against his inclination, was despatched to hunt
up the axes. It was only a moment before he
returned with them.</p>
<p>Rebstock, with a show of virtue, reprimanded
Perry severely for harboring the men that had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
stolen the axes. &#8220;Sorry it happened, colonel,&#8221; he
grumbled, after he had abused the thieves roundly
in a general way, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll see it doesn&#8217;t happen
again. We can&#8217;t watch everybody in a place
like this. Tell your men,&#8221; he continued, expanding
his chest, &#8220;to leave their axes with me when
they come to Sellersville&ndash;&ndash;what?&#8221;</p>
<p>The assurances were lost on Stanley. &#8220;Rebstock,&#8221;
said he, in a tone that Bucks had not
heard before from him, &#8220;take your personal effects,
all of you&ndash;&ndash;and nothing else&ndash;&ndash;and load them
on a flatboat. I will give you one hour to get-out
of here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rebstock almost fell over backward. He
wheezed in amazement. There was an outburst
of indignant protests. A dozen men clamored at
once. Perry rushed forward to threaten Stanley;
others cursed and defied him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you, and what do you mean giving
orders like that?&#8221; demanded Seagrue, confronting
him angrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter who I am, you will obey the orders.
And you can&#8217;t take any tents or gambling apparatus
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
or liquors. Pack up your clothes and
camp stuff&ndash;&ndash;nothing else&ndash;&ndash;and get out.&#8221;</p>
<p>If a bombshell had dropped into Sellersville,
consternation could not have been more complete.
But it became quickly apparent that not all of
the gang would surrender without a fight. The
leaders retreated for a hurried consultation.</p>
<p>Rebstock walked back presently and confronted
Stanley. &#8220;What&#8217;s your law for this?&#8221; he demanded,
breathless with anger.</p>
<p>Stanley pointed to the ground under their feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your title to this land, Rebstock? It
belongs to the railroad that those ties belong to.
Where is your license from the United States Government
to sell whiskey here? You are trespassers
and outlaws, with no rights that any decent man
ought to respect. You and your gang are human
parasites, and you are going to be stripped and
sent down the river as fast as these flatboats will
carry you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without waiting for any rejoinder, Stanley
turned on his heel and walked away, leaving Rebstock
speechless. The threats against the intruders
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
continued, but Stanley paid no attention to
any of them. Scott and the five troopers faced
the gamblers. Stanley called to the two wood-choppers,
who stood near with their axes, and
pointed to the gambling tents.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chop up every wheel and table in there you
can find,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>A cry went up from Perry when he heard
the order, but the axemen, nothing loath, sprang
inside to their work, and the crashing of the gambling
furniture resounded through the alarmed
camp. Stanley made no delay of his peremptory
purpose. The tent attacked belonged to Seagrue,
who, common report averred, feared nothing and
nobody, while the gambling implements were
Perry&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Seagrue rushed to his property, revolver in
hand. Bill Dancing, who stood at Stanley&#8217;s side,
stepped into his way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on, Seagrue,&#8221; he said. The gambler, fully
as large a man as Dancing, faced his opponent
with his features fixed in rage. &#8220;Get away,&#8221;
he shouted, &#8220;or I will knock your head off.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></div>
<p>All eyes centred on the two men. Every one
realized that open war was on and that it needed
only a spark to start the shooting. The gamblers,
rallying to Seagrue, backed him with oaths and
threats.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seagrue, put down that pistol or I&#8217;ll wring
your neck,&#8221; returned the lineman, baring his right
arm as he sauntered toward the outlaw. Bucks,
beside Stanley, stood transfixed as he watched
Dancing. The lineman&#8217;s revolver was slung in
the holster at his side.</p>
<p>Seagrue hesitated. He saw Bob Scott standing
in the doorway of the gambling tent with his rifle
lying carelessly over his arm. He was actually
covering Seagrue where he stood&ndash;&ndash;and Seagrue
knew that Bob Scott was deadly with a rifle.
But Dancing was walking directly up to him and
Seagrue dared not be shamed before his own associates.
He jumped back to fire, but it was too
late.</p>
<p>Dancing caught his wrist. Both were men of
great strength, and their muscles knotted as
they grappled. It was only after a moment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
that the lineman could be seen to gain. Then,
as he bent the gambler&#8217;s arm back, he suddenly
released it and struck the revolver out of his
hand. Seagrue, with a curse, sprang back, and
drawing a knife rushed for the second time at
the lineman. Dancing jumped to one side. As he
did so he seized an axe from the hand of one of the
choppers and turned again on Seagrue. The gambler
made a lunge at his throat, but as he threw
himself forward, Dancing, springing away, brought
the axe around like a flash and laid it flat across
his assailant&#8217;s forearm. The knife flew twenty
feet, and before the gambler could recover himself
the railroad man with one hand like a vice
on his throat bore him to the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me a piece of rope,&#8221; muttered Dancing
as Stanley ran up.</p>

<p class='caption'>
IT WAS ONLY AFTER A MOMENT THAT<br />
THE LINEMAN COULD BE SEEN TO GAIN.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>Bob Scott slashed a tent guy and handed it to
him. In another minute Dancing, in spite of
Seagrue&#8217;s struggles, had lashed his prisoner hand
and foot. Picking him up bodily, he walked
unopposed to the landing, and to the astonishment
of the spectators heaved Seagrue with scant
ceremony into a flatboat. There a trooper kept
him quiet. Walking back, the lineman brushed
the dust of the encounter from his arms as if
to invite any further Sellersville champion to
come forward. But John Rebstock, the really
responsible head of the place, showed no desire
to meet Dancing, and Perry, the sneak of the
trio, only ranted while Rebstock stood at a respectable
distance wheezing his surprise at the
tremendous exhibition of strength. And the work
of destruction went forward.</p>
<p>Adjoining the Seagrue tent stood a saloon in
which the men were now ordered to demolish the
stock. This renewed the excitement among Rebstock&#8217;s
followers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t waste any time,&#8221; was Stanley&#8217;s order.
&#8220;They may rush us. Knock in the head of a
keg of whiskey, pour it over the bar, and burn
the shanty.&#8221;</p>
<p>The gamblers were, in fact, mustering for a
charge on the invaders. Before they could act the
saloon was ablaze and the flames, rising amid the
yells and execrations of its owners, leaped to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
big tent adjoining. In front of this the soldiers in
a skirmish line held back the scurrying outlaws.
Within a few moments Sellersville was ablaze
from end to end and its population, including
Perry and Rebstock, driven to the flatboats, were
floating with threats and curses down the muddy
current of the Spider Water.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>
<p>Stanley&#8217;s next camp was pitched down the
river where the overland telegraph line crossed
the Spider Water, and Bucks, installed in a smart
army tent with a cracker-box for a stool and a
packing-case for an instrument table, was, through
Dancing&#8217;s efforts, put in communication by wire
with Medicine Bend and the west country as far
as Sleepy Cat, where the War Department was establishing
an army post.</p>
<p>Stanley, with Bob Scott, now spent a great deal
of time in the saddle between the bridge and the
upper tie-camps, and his presence made itself felt
in the renewed energy everywhere apparent among
the contractors and their men. Bucks, chained
to a wire, as he expressed it, found the days dragging
again and would much rather have been at
liberty to ride with Scott, who, when free, hunted
in the foot-hills.</p>
<p>One day Bucks was sitting alone in his tent,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
looking for the hundredth time over a worn copy
of <i>Harper&#8217;s Weekly</i> that he had picked up at Casement&#8217;s
camp, when a dog put his nose in the tent
door. A glance revealed merely a disconsolate,
unpromising cur, yet Bucks thought he had seen
the dog before and was interested. He seemed of
an all-over alkali-brown hue, scant of hair, scant
of tail, and with only melancholy dewlap ears to
suggest a strain of nobler blood in an earlier ancestry.
He looked in with the furtive eye of the
tramp, and as if expecting that a boot or a club
would most probably be his welcome.</p>
<p>But Bucks at the moment was lonely&ndash;&ndash;as lonely
as the dog himself&ndash;&ndash;and as the two fixed their eyes
intently on each other, Bucks remembered that
this was the tie foreman&#8217;s dog, Scuffy.</p>
<p>Scuffy had appeared at the psychological moment.
Bucks regarded him in silence, and the dog
perceiving no immediate danger of assault
stood, in silence, returning Bucks&#8217;s stare. Then
watching the boy&#8217;s eye carefully, the dog cocked
his head just the least bit to one side. It was a
mute appeal, but a moving one. Bucks continued,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
however, his non-committal scrutiny, recalling
that the foreman had said nothing good
of Scuffy, and the homeless cur stood in doubt
as to his reception. But realizing, perhaps, that
he had nothing to lose and everything to gain,
the little vagabond played his last card&ndash;&ndash;he
wagged his stubby tail.</p>
<p>A harder heart than Bucks&#8217;s might have been
touched. The operator held out his hand. No
more was needed; the melancholy tramp stepped
cautiously forward waving his alert flag of truce.
He sniffed long and carefully as he neared Bucks,
looked solicitously into the boy&#8217;s eyes, and then
smelt and licked the proffered hand. It was a
token of submission as plainly expressed as when
Friday, kneeling, placed Robinson Crusoe&#8217;s foot
on his head. Bucks reached into a paper bag
that Bill Dancing had left on the table and gave
the dog a cracker.</p>
<p>Scuffy snapped up the offering like one starving.
A second cracker and a third disappeared at single
gulps. For the length of the dog, the size of
his mouth appeared enormous. In a moment the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
cracker-bag was emptied and Scuffy again licked
the friendly hand. It did not take Bucks long to
decide what to do. In another moment he had
resolved to adopt his tramp visitor. The day
happened to be Friday, and Bucks at once renamed
him Friday. When Dancing, who had
been with Bob Scott hunting, came in late that
night he found Bucks asleep and Scuffy lying in
Dancing&#8217;s own bed, from which he was ejected
only after the most vigorous language on his own
part as well as on that of the lineman. Even
then, Scuffy retreated only as far as Bucks&#8217;s feet,
where he slept for the rest of the night undisturbed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did he come from?&#8221; growled Dancing
in the morning as he sat with his pipe regarding
the intruder, who acted quite at home, with a
critical eye.</p>
<p>Bucks explained that this was the tie foreman&#8217;s
runaway dog, Scuffy, and beyond Scuffy&#8217;s first appearance
at the tent door he could tell him nothing.
Scuffy simply and promptly assumed a place
in camp and Bucks became, willy-nilly, his sponsor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
But his effort to rename him came to nothing.
Scuffy gave no heed when called &#8220;Friday,&#8221;
but for &#8220;Scuffy&#8221; he sprang to attention instantly.</p>
<p>Bill Dancing decided, off-hand, that &#8220;the pup&#8221;
was worthless. Scott, whose smile was kindly
even when sceptical, only corrected Bill to the
extent of saying that Friday or Scuffy, whoever
or whatever he might be, was no pup; that he
was a full-grown dog and in Bob&#8217;s judgment he
would need no guardian.</p>
<p>One day, shortly after Scuffy had been put
upon the pay-roll, Scott came in from a trip after
venison with word that there were black bears in
the hill canyons. The thought of bear&#8217;s meat
aroused every one, and Stanley suggested a bear
hunt. Scott had to send down to Stanley&#8217;s ranch
at Medicine Bend for his dogs and some delay
followed. But when the three hounds arrived
there was excitement enough to compensate for
it. One of the dogs was a big black fellow and
his companions were brown full-bloods. The
hounds, one and all, set on Scuffy the moment
they reached camp, and it was only by the most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
dexterous man&oelig;uvres that the strange dog escaped
being eaten alive. Indeed, Bob Scott remarked
at once that if Scuffy should survive the
greetings of his new comrades he would prove his
right to live. The hounds always set upon him
at meal-times, usually chewed him at bed-time,
and harried him at all times.</p>
<p>To a less hopeful temperament than Scuffy&#8217;s,
life would not have seemed worth living. It was
only Bucks who insured him anything at all to
eat, and the enmity of the big, rangy hounds for
the lean and hungry tramp dog left him no peace
save when they were fighting in dreams. To
accept life under such conditions indicated that
Scuffy was a philosopher, and he accepted the
conditions cheerfully, filching what he could of
sustenance from the common pot and licking his
troublesome wounds at night after his truculent
companions had gone to sleep.</p>
<p>As soon as the tie-supply trouble had been lessened
Stanley took things more leisurely and the
interval afforded the opportunity for the delayed
bear hunt. Bob Scott and Dancing were to go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
with Stanley, and Bucks being freed for one day
from his key was invited to be of the party. All
hands were in the saddle by daybreak, and Scott&#8217;s
hounds were baying and tearing around camp
wild with excitement.</p>
<p>At the last moment a complication arose.
Scuffy, who until the moment of starting had for
prudential reasons&ndash;&ndash;that is, to avoid being eaten
up&ndash;&ndash;remained in obscurity, joined the hunters.
Every one in turn tried to drive him back, but
long practice had made him expert in dodging
missiles and had rendered him insensible to reproach.
The hounds were too filled with the
prospect of sport to pay any attention to Scuffy.
In vain, Bob Scott tried to set them on him and
drive him back to camp. On this occasion, when
bullying would plainly have been justified, no
hound would assail Scuffy. Bucks drove him
again and again from the flank of the advance
only to have the mortification of seeing him reappear
a mile or two farther along the trail, and
it was at last decided to leave him to his fate at
the paw of a bear&ndash;&ndash;which no one made doubt he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
was certain to suffer. At that moment Bucks
and Bill Dancing, riding together, saw a deer
frightened from a thicket running toward the
river. Bucks jumped from his horse and lifted
his rifle to take a shot, but by the time he was
ready to fire the deer had vanished.</p>
<p>Led by Scott, the hunters rode at once into the
rough country to the west, where in the mountain
fastnesses the bears loved to feed. The hounds
gave tongue vigorously, and Scuffy, who had by
this time not only established himself but had
impudently taken the lead and was heading the
pack, barked loudest and longest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did anybody ever see conceit equal to that?&#8221;
demanded Stanley. &#8220;Look at that cur leading
the hounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucks was mortified and expressed his regret.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind him, Bucks,&#8221; remarked Dancing
consolingly. &#8220;That dog won&#8217;t bother long. The first
time the hounds run in, the bear will finish <i>him</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucks did not know precisely what Bill meant
by &#8220;running in,&#8221; but he was not to be long in
doubt. The pack struck a fresh trail almost at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
once and the hunters had a long ride along a
mountain-side covered with fallen timber and cut
by innumerable wash-outs that made the riding
hard and dangerous. Scott found intervals to
encourage Bucks, whose youth and inexperience
made his task of keeping up with the others a
difficult one. &#8220;Take it easy,&#8221; said Scott encouragingly
as the operator tried to urge his mount.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am keeping you all back, Bob.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Plenty of time. You are doing wonders for
mountain-riding. When we close in on the bear
don&#8217;t be too keen to get near him. You wouldn&#8217;t
be safe for a minute on your horse if the dogs
didn&#8217;t keep the bear busy. As long as the dogs
worry the bear you are safe. A bear will never
chase a man as long as a dog keeps at him. It&#8217;s
only when the dogs refuse to go in any longer
that the danger begins. When that happens, look
out. Keep a respectful distance all the time and
a road open behind you. That&#8217;s all there is to a
bear fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he spoke, the hounds yelped sharply and
Scott spurred forward. The hunters were threading
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
a grove of quaking asp and the dogs had come
up with the bear on an opening of shale rock surrounded
by down timber. Throwing his reins and
advancing cautiously on foot, Stanley, followed by
his companions, who spread themselves in a wide
semicircle, took his place, the others, as they best
could, choosing their own.</p>
<p>The bear, a full-grown male, met the onset of
the hounds with grim confidence. The dogs encircled
him with a ring of ferocious teeth, running
in from behind whenever they could to nip the
huge beast in the haunches or on the flank. But
the surprise of the encounter was Scuffy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look,&#8221; cried Bill Dancing, under whose wing
Bucks had taken his post. &#8220;Look at him! Why,
the pup is a world-beater!&#8221;</p>
<p>In truth, Scuffy was the liveliest and most impudent
dog in the pack, and when the fight was
fully on, managed to worry the angry bear more
than the hounds did. Within a moment the black
hound, over-bold, imprudently rushed the bear in
front. A paw darting from the huge beast caught
him like a trip-hammer and stretched him helpless.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
In that moment the bear exposed himself
to Stanley&#8217;s rifle and a shot rang across the
mountain-side. Scott watched the result anxiously.
But the slug instead of dropping the bear served
only to enrage him. For an instant the two hounds
lost their heads and the infuriated bear charged
Bucks and Bill Dancing.</p>
<p>The shale opening became a scene of confusion.
Exposing himself recklessly, Scott tried to urge
the dogs forward, but they had lost their nerve.
It needed only this to upset everything. The
hunters closed in together, and the critical moment
had come; deaf alike to command and entreaty,
the two hounds refused to go in, and
Scuffy, flying wildly about the bear, seemed unable
to check him. Dancing stopped long enough to
take one shot, and ran&ndash;&ndash;with Bucks, who had
found no chance to shoot, following. The bear
gained fast on the long-legged lineman and his
boy companion. A wash-out, hidden by a clump
of bushes, lay directly in the path of flight. Dancing,
perceiving it, dashed to the left and escaped.
He shouted a warning to Bucks, who, not understanding,
plunged straight over the declivity and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
sprawled into the wash-out with the bear after
him. Catching his rifle, the boy scrambled to
his feet with his pursuer less than twenty feet
away. Between the two there was only open
ground, and the bear was scrambling for Bucks
when Scuffy sprang down the shale bank and
confronted the enemy.</p>
<p>It looked like certain death for Scuffy, but the
tramp dog did not hesitate. He rushed at the
bear with a fury of snapping, though not without
a lively respect for the sweep of the brute&#8217;s fore
paws. The little dog, freeing himself forever in
that moment from the stigma of cur, put up a
fight that astonished the big brute.</p>
<p>Scuffy raced at him first on one side and then
on the other, bounding in and out like a rubber
ball, dashing across his front and running clear
around the circling bear, nipping even an occasional
mouthful of hair from his haunches. He
made noise enough for a pack of dogs and simulated
a fury that gave the bear the surprise of his
life. Bucks realized that only his four-legged friend
stood between him and destruction and that so
unequal a contest could not endure long. Skilful as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
the little fellow was, he was pitted against an antagonist
quite as quick and wary. The clumsiness
of the bear was no more than seeming, and
any one of the terrific blows he dealt at Scuffy
with his huge paw would have stretched a man
lifeless. Bucks, collecting his disordered faculties,
raised his rifle to help his champion with a shot.
His heart beat like a hammer in his throat, but
he knew there was only one thing to do, that was
to get the rifle-sights carefully lined in his eye and
shoot when Scuffy gave him an opening.</p>
<p>It came in a moment when the bear turned to
smash Scuffy on his flank. Bucks fired. To his
amazement, no result followed. The failure of
the bear to show any sign of being hit stunned
him, and he drew his revolver, never expecting to
escape alive, when two shots rang across the wash
as close together as if fired by the same hand.
The bear sank like a falling tree. Yet he rallied
and again rushed for Bucks, despite Scuffy&#8217;s stout
opposition and the yells from above, and finally
halted only when Bob Scott, jumping into the
wash-out, confronted him with a knife. There was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
an instant of apprehension, broken by a third
shot from Dancing&#8217;s rifle across the gully, and the
bear crumpled lifeless almost at Scott&#8217;s feet.</p>
<p>The scout turned to Bucks as he stood dazed
by his narrow escape. Stanley, above, shouted.
And Bill Dancing, carrying his empty rifle, and
with his face bleeding from the briers, made
his way down the opposite side of the wash.
Scuffy, mounting the body of his dead foe, barked
furiously.</p>
<p>The little dog was the real hero of the encounter.
He had paid his keep and earned his way as
a member of the family and as a bear-fighter.
When Bucks picked up his rifle he told Scott of
his bad miss in the critical moment of the fight.
Bob took the gun from his hands and examined
the sights good-naturedly. Bucks had neglected
to change the elevation after he had aimed at the
deer an hour earlier.</p>
<p>&#8220;Next time you shoot at a bear twenty feet
away, don&#8217;t leave your sights set for two hundred
yards,&#8221; was all Scott said.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>
<p>The bruises that Bucks nursed were tender
for some days, and Scott tried out some bear&#8217;s
grease for an ointment.</p>
<p>Scuffy, who had come out of the fight without
a scratch, took on new airs in camp, and returned
evil for evil by bullying the two wounded hounds
who were too surprised by his aggressiveness to
make an effective defence.</p>
<p>Bucks, when he was alone with the dog and
time dragged heavily, turned for diversion to the
only book in the camp, a well-thumbed copy of
&#8220;The Last of the Mohicans.&#8221; He had brought
it with him to read coming out from Pittsburgh,
and had thrown it into his bag when leaving Medicine
Bend. In camp it proved a treasure, even
the troopers, when they were idle, casting lots to
get hold of it.</p>
<p>One day, when Bucks was absorbed in the romance,
Bob Scott asked him what he was reading.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
Bucks tried to give him some idea of the story.
Scott showed little apparent interest in the r&eacute;sum&eacute;,
but he listened respectfully while cleaning
his rifle. He made no comment until Bucks had
done.</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of Indians did you say those were,&#8221;
he asked, contracting his brows as he did when
a subject perplexed him, &#8220;Uncas and Chingachgook?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Delawares, Bob. Know anything about Delaware
Indians?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott shook his head. &#8220;Never heard of Delawares
in our country. I saw a Pottawottamie
Indian once, but never any Delawares. Is this
story about Uncas a true story?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As true as any story. Listen here.&#8221; Bucks
read aloud to him for a while, his companion at
intervals asking questions and approving or criticising
the Indian classic.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you could only read, Bob, you ought to
read the whole book,&#8221; said Bucks regretfully, as
he put the volume aside.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can read a little,&#8221; returned Scott, to Bucks&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
surprise. &#8220;All except the long words,&#8221; added the
scout modestly. &#8220;A man down at Medicine Bend
tried to sell me a pair of spectacles once. They
had gold rims, and he told me that a man with
those spectacles could read any kind of a book.
He thought I was a greenhorn,&#8221; said the scout.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you learn to read?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A Blackrobe taught me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucks held out the book. &#8220;Then read this,
Bob, sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott looked at the worn volume, but shook
his head doubtfully. &#8220;Looks like a pretty big
book for me. But if you can find out whether it&#8217;s
true, I might try it sometime.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stanley, after a few days, started up the river
with Scott and Dancing, leaving his men in
camp. Bucks, who was still too stiff to ride,
likewise remained to receive any messages that
might come.</p>
<p>There was an abundance of water-fowl in the
sloughs and ponds up and down the river, and
Bucks, the morning after Stanley&#8217;s departure,
leaving the troopers lounging in camp, started out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
with a shot-gun to look for ducks. He passed the
first bend up-stream, and working his way toward
a small pond thickly fringed with alders, where
he had often seen teal and mallards, attempted
to crawl within gunshot of it.</p>
<p>He was working his way in this fashion toward
the edge of the water when he heard a clatter of
wings and the next moment a flock of mallards
rushed in swift flight over his head. He impulsively
threw up his gun to fire but some instinct
checked him. He was in a country of dangerous
enemies and the thought of bears still loomed
large in his mind. An instant&#8217;s reflection convinced
him that it was not his movement that
had frightened the ducks, and he was enough of a
hunter to look further than that for the cause.
As caution seemed, from the soreness of his legs
and arms, plainly indicated, he lay still to await
developments.</p>
<p>Soon he heard a movement of trampling feet,
and, seemingly, across the pond from him. Bucks
thought of buffaloes. His heart beat fast at the
thought of getting a shot at one until he reflected
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
that he had no rifle. The next instant his heart
stopped beating. Not ten feet from where he lay
in the thick willows, an Indian carrying a rifle, and
in war-paint, stole noiselessly along toward the
camp. No sooner had he disappeared than a
second brave followed, and while Bucks was
digesting this fright a third warrior, creeping
in the same stealthy manner and almost without
a sound, passed the staring boy; the appearance
of a fourth and a fifth raised the hair on Bucks&#8217;s
head till he was almost stunned with fright, but
he had still to count three more in the party,
one more ferocious-looking than another, before
all had passed.</p>
<p>What to do was the question that forced itself
on him. He feared the Indians would attack the
troopers in camp, and this he felt would be a massacre,
since the men, not suspecting danger, would
be taken wholly unawares. Should he fire his
gun as a signal? It would probably bring the
Indians back upon him, but the thought of allowing
the troopers to be butchered was insupportable.
His hammers were cocked and his finger
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
was on one trigger when he considered how useless
the alarm would be. The troopers knew that he
had gone duck hunting. They would expect to
hear him shoot and would pay no attention to it.
To rush out after the Indians would only invite
his instant death.</p>
<p>There seemed nothing he could do and a cold
sweat of apprehension broke over him. But if he
fired his gun he might, at least, surprise the Indians.
The report of a gun in their rear would
alarm them&ndash;&ndash;since they knew nothing of his presence
or his duck hunting and might take fright.
Without more ado he fired both barrels one after
the other, careful only to shoot low into the willows,
hoping the smoke would not rise so quickly
as to betray him before he could make a dash for
a new hiding-place.</p>
<p>His ruse worked and he ran at top speed for
twenty yards before he threw himself into a clump
of cotton-woods close to the camp trail and began
to reload. While he was doing so a shout came
from the direction of the railroad bridge. Not
until then did Bucks understand what the Indians
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
were after. But had he not understood, he
would have known a moment later when he heard
a sharp exchange of shots toward the camp, heard
the dogs barking furiously, and saw the Indians,
now on their ponies, running the troopers&#8217; horses
past him at a breakneck gallop. The Indians
yelled lustily at the success of their raid, the stampeded
horses dashed panic-stricken before them,
and the braves shouted back in derision at the
vain efforts of the troopers to stop them with useless
bullets. Bucks&#8217;s own impulse was to empty
a charge of birdshot into the last of the fleeing
warriors, but this he knew might cost him his life,
and he resisted the temptation. When he was
sure all were past he ran toward the bluffs, and
gaining a little eminence saw the fleeing Indians,
a dozen in all, making their way jubilantly up
the river. At the camp the discomfited cavalrymen
were preparing for a siege, and in their
excitement almost shot Bucks as he hove in sight.</p>
<p>Bucks gave a good description of the marauders,
and, following him up to the pond, six of the
troopers attempted some pursuit. This, to unmounted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
men, was useless, as they well knew.
Indeed, they used caution not to come unawares
on any friends of the escaping braves that might
have lingered behind.</p>
<p>Colonel Stanley returned in the morning to hear
that his escort had been unhorsed. Bob Scott
grinned at the cavalrymen as they told the story.
He assured them that they had got off lightly, and
that if Bucks&#8217;s signals had not alarmed the little
war-party they might have carried away scalps
as well as horses.</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall be in luck if we don&#8217;t hear more of
those fellows,&#8221; said he to Bucks afterward. There
was now manifestly nothing to do but to go in,
and later in the day a freight train was flagged
and the whole party, with Scuffy and the hounds,
returned to Casement&#8217;s camp. Scott sent his dogs
thence to the ranch in Medicine Bend, and at
Bucks&#8217;s urgent request Scuffy was sent with
them to await his own return to head-quarters.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>
<p>The foray of the Indians at the Spider Water
Bridge proved, as Bob Scott had feared, only
a forerunner of active hostilities. Casement had
already taken all necessary measures of defence.
His construction camp was moved steadily westward,
though sometimes inside the picket lines
of troops, despite the warring Indians and the difficulties
of his situation. Alarms, however, were
continual and the graders, many of whom were
old soldiers, worked at all times with their muskets
stacked on the dump beside them. In the
construction camp Bucks saw also many negroes,
and at night the camp-fires of their quarters were
alive with the singing and dancing of the old
plantation life in the South.</p>
<p>While waiting for Stanley&#8217;s inspection of the
grading and track-laying, Bucks relieved at times
the camp operator, whose principal business was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
the rushing of emphatic demands to Omaha for
material and supplies.</p>
<p>During other intervals Bucks found a chance
to study the system that underlay the seemingly
hopeless confusion of the construction work. The
engineers moving far in advance had located the
line, and following these came the graders and
bridge- and culvert-builders, cutting through the
hills, levelling the fills, and spanning the streams
and water-ways with trestles and wooden bridges,
miles in advance of the main army. Behind these
came Casement&#8217;s own big camp with the tiemen,
the track-layers, and the ballast gangs.</p>
<p>Every Eastern market was drawn upon for materials,
and when these reached Omaha, trains
loaded with them were constantly pushed to the
front. The chief spiker of the rail gang, taking a
fancy to Bucks, invited him to go out with the
rail-layers one day, and Bucks took a temporary
commission as spike-dropper.</p>
<p>To do this, he followed Dancing up the track
past a long construction train in which the men
lived. The big box-cars contained sleeping-bunks,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
and those men who preferred more air and seclusion
had swung sleeping-hammocks under the cars;
others had spread their beds on top of the cars.
Climbing a little embankment, Bucks watched the
sturdy, broad-shouldered pioneers. A light car
drawn by a single, galloping horse was rushed to
the extreme end of the laid rails. Before it had
fairly stopped, two men waiting on either side
seized the end of a rail with their trap and started
forward. Ten more men, following in twos, at a
run, lifted the two rails clear of the car and dropped
them in place on the ties. The foreman instantly
gauged them, the horse moved ahead, and thirty
spikers armed with heavy mauls drove the spikes
furiously and regularly, three strokes to the spike,
into the new-laid ties. The bolters followed with
the fish-plates, and while Bucks looked the railroad
was made before his eyes.</p>
<p>The excitement of the scene was unforgettable.
In less than sixty seconds four rails had gone
down. The moment a horse-car was emptied
it was dumped off one side of the track, and a
loaded car with its horse galloping to the front
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
had passed it. The next instant the &#8220;empty&#8221;
was lifted back on the rails, and at the end of
a sixty-foot rope the horse, ridden by a hustling
boy, was being urged back to where the
rails were transferred from the regular flat cars.
The clang of the heavy iron, the continuous ring
of the spike mauls, the shouting of the orders,
the throwing of each empty horse-car from the
track to make way for a loaded one, these things
were all new and stimulating to Bucks. The
chief spiker laughed when the young operator
told him how fine it was. He asked Bucks to
look at his watch and time the work. In half
an hour Bucks looked at his watch again. In
the interval the gang had laid eight hundred feet
of track.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how you can work so fast,&#8221; declared
Bucks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know how many times,&#8221; demanded
the spiker, &#8220;those sledges have to swing? There
are eighteen ties and thirty-six spikes to every
rail, three hundred and fifty-two rails to every
mile, and eighteen hundred miles from Omaha
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
to San Francisco&ndash;&ndash;those sledges will swing sixty-eight
million times before the rails are full-spiked&ndash;&ndash;they
have to go fast.&#8221;</p>
<p>The words were hardly out of the chief spiker&#8217;s
mouth when a cry of alarm rang from the front.
Bucks, looking eagerly, saw in the west a cloud
of dust. At the same time he saw the tie gang
running in dozens for their lives from the divide
where they were working toward the camp. The
men beyond them on the grade had scrambled
into the wagons, dumped any ties they might
contain helter-skelter to the ground, and were
clinging to the wagon boxes. In these, the drivers
standing up, lashed their horses with whip and
line for life, and death, while everywhere beside
and behind them other men on foot were racing
back to safety.</p>
<p>New clouds of dust rose along the grade from
the flying wagon wheels, the horses tore madly
on, and as the heavy wagons jolted over the loose
stones, the fugitives, yelling with excitement and
alarm and clinging to one another as they
bounced up and down, looked anxiously behind.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></div>
<p>There was no uncertainty as to the cause of
the panic. &#8220;Indians!&#8221; was the cry everywhere.
Every man in camp had dropped his working
implement and was moving somewhere on the
double-quick. Every one, it seemed to Bucks,
was shouting and running. But above the confusion
of the surprise and the babel of voices,
Bucks heard the sharp tones of Jack Casement
giving orders.</p>
<p>The old soldiers in the working gang needed
no further discipline. The timid and the skulkers
scurried for the box-cars and the dugouts. On
the other hand, the soldiers ran for the dumps
where the arms were stacked, and seizing their
muskets hurried back and, trained for the emergency,
fell into line under their foremen.</p>
<p>Casement, musket in hand, taking the largest
company of men as they formed in fours behind
him, started forward at the double-quick, yelling
now for the moral effect, to protect the retreat of
the wagons. The men, scattering as they reached
the edge of the camp, dropped into every spot of
shelter, and at the same moment Stanley, mounted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
and alive with the vim and fire of the soldier, led
a smaller body of men rapidly back to guard the
rear of the camp, deploying his little force about
the box-cars and flat cars as they hastened on.
In an instant the construction camp had become
a fortress defended by a thousand men.</p>
<p>It was none too soon. Stirring the yellow plain
with the fury of a whirlwind, a band of Sioux
warriors rode the fleeing railroaders furiously
down. They appeared phantom-like out of every
slip and canyon, and rode full-panoplied from
behind every hill. The horizon that had shown
five minutes before only the burning sunshine
and the dull glare of the alkali sinks, danced now
with the flying ponies of the Indians, and the hills
echoed with ominous cries.</p>
<p>Without a word of warning, the few fleeing men
who had been working too far from camp to reach
it in safety were mercilessly cut down. Their
comrades under arms, with an answering cry of
defiance poured a volley of cartridge balls into the
thin, black circle that rode ever closer and closer
to the muzzles of the muskets. Jack Casement
and his brother Dan recklessly urged their men
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
to the most advanced posts of defence, and from
behind scrapers, wagons, flat cars, and friendly
hillocks the railroad men poured a galling fire into
their active foe.</p>
<p>The Indians, seeking with unerring instinct the
weakest point in the defence, converged in hundreds
upon the long string of box-cars that made
up the construction train at the rear of the camp,
where Stanley, extending his few men in a resolute
skirmish line, endeavored to prevent the savages
from scalping the non-combatant cooks and
burning the sleeping-cars. Bucks saw, conspicuous
in the attack, a slender Sioux chief riding
a strong-limbed, fleet pony with a coat of burnished
gold and as much filled with the fire of
the fight as his master was. Riding hither and
thither and swinging a long, heavy musket like
a marshal&#8217;s baton, the Sioux warrior, almost
everywhere at once, urged his men to the fighting,
and the fate of the few white men they were
able to cut down or scalp before Stanley could
cover the line of box-cars seemed to add vigor
to their onslaught.</p>
<p>Stanley himself, attacked by ten braves for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
every man he could muster at that point with a
gun, dashed up and down the old wagon roads
along the right of way, a conspicuous target for
the Indians. His hat, in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, had disappeared,
and, swinging a heavy Colt&#8217;s revolver,
which the Indians shrank from with a healthy instinct
of danger, he pressed back the hungry red
line again and again, supported only by such
musketry fire as the men crouching under, within,
and between the box-cars could offer.</p>
<p>Wherever he rode his wily foes retreated, but
they closed in constantly behind him, and one
brave, more daring than his fellows, succeeded in
setting fire to a box-car. A shout of triumph rose
from the circling horsemen, but it was short-lived.
Stanley, wheeling like a flash, gave chase to the
incendiary. The Sioux rode for his life, but his
pony&#8217;s pace was no match for the springing strides
of Stanley&#8217;s American horse.</p>
<p>For an instant the attention of the whole fight
in the rear of the camp was drawn upon the rash
brave and his pursuer. Bucks, with straining eyes
and beating heart, awaited the result. He saw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
Stanley steadily closing the gap that separated
him from his fleeing enemy. Then the revolver
was thrown suddenly upward and forward, and
smoke flashed from the muzzle. The echo of the
report had hardly reached Bucks&#8217;s ears when the
revolver, swung high again to balance the rhythm
of the horse&#8217;s flight, was fired again, and a third
time, at the doomed man.</p>
<p>The Indian, bending forward on his horse, caught
convulsively at his mane, then rising high in his
seat plunged head-foremost to the ground, and
his riderless horse fled on. His pursuer, wheeling,
threw himself flat in his saddle to escape the fire
bent upon him from behind as he rode back. At
that moment Dan Casement and his men hurried
up on the double-quick. With him came Bucks,
who had secured a rifle and fallen in. Some
men of the welcome reinforcement were set at putting
out the fire. Others strengthened Stanley&#8217;s
scattered skirmish line.</p>
<p>Convinced by the determined front now opposed
to him of the impossibility of rushing the camp, the
Sioux chief gave the signal to retire.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></div>
<p>As if the earth had opened to swallow them up,
the warriors melted away, and as suddenly as the
plain had borne them into life it now concealed
their disappearance. In twenty minutes they had
come and gone as completely as if they had never
been. But in that short interval they had left
death and consternation in their wake.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>
<p>Stirred by the increasing boldness of the
Indians, Stanley returned with his party to Medicine
Bend to take further measures for the defence
of the railroad men.</p>
<p>Bucks, when he reported to Baxter, the train
despatcher, found new orders waiting for him.
He was directed to take charge of the station at
Goose Creek. The train did not leave till night,
and Bucks took advantage of the interval to go
uptown to make some necessary purchases of linen
and clothing. On his way back to the station,
with his package under his arm, he saw, on the
edge of the broad sidewalk, Harvey Levake. Levake
was standing near a wooden-Indian cigar-store
sign, looking directly at Bucks as the latter
walked toward him. The operator, nodding as
he came up, asked Levake, without parley, whether
he would give him the money for the express
charges on the cartridges.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></div>
<p>If Bucks had exploded a keg of powder on the
sidewalk there could not have been a greater
change in the outlaw&#8217;s manner. He stared at
Bucks with contempt enough to pierce the feelings
of the wooden Indian beside which he stood.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; he demanded, throwing his
head menacingly forward.</p>
<p>Bucks repeated his request, but so mildly that
Levake took additional umbrage at his diffidence.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here,&#8221; he muttered in a voice beginning
like a distant roll of thunder and gathering
force and volume as he continued, &#8220;don&#8217;t insult
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucks ventured to urge that he intended no
insult.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t insult me!&#8221; bellowed Levake in violent
tones.</p>
<p>Again Bucks attempted to protest. It was useless.
Levake insisted with increasing wrath upon
hugging the insult to himself, while Bucks struggled
manfully to get it away from him. And as
Levake&#8217;s loud words did not attract as much attention
up and down the street as he sought, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
stamped about on the sidewalk. Bucks&#8217;s efforts
to pacify him made matters momentarily worse.</p>
<p>Meantime a crowd such as Levake desired had
gathered and Bucks found himself a target for
the outlaw&#8217;s continued abuse, with nobody to take
his part. Moreover, the expressions on the faces
about him now made him realize his peril quite
as much as anything in Levake&#8217;s words. It was
becoming painfully evident that the onlookers
were merely waiting to see Levake shoot him
down.</p>
<p>&#8220;No man in Medicine Bend can insult me and
live,&#8221; cried Levake, winding up a tirade of abuse.
&#8220;I&#8217;m known from one end of this street to the
other. Nobody can spread lies in it about me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew and flourished a revolver as he spoke.
None in the crowd interfered with so much as a
word. But even before the outlaw had finished
what he was saying, a man of medium size and
easy manner elbowed his way quietly through the
circle of spectators, and, taking Bucks by the arm,
drew him back and faced Levake himself. It was
Bob Scott.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s all this about, Levake?&#8221; demanded
Scott gently.</p>
<p>Levake had no alternative but to turn his wrath
upon the Indian scout. Yet those who knew him
perceived that it was done without much stomach
for the job. Instead of growing momentarily
greater the violence of his abuse now grew
steadily less, and the thunder in his tones rolled
further and further from the subject.</p>
<p>Half-turning to Bucks, Scott laid his hand on
his arm again. &#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; said he, deliberately
and quietly, &#8220;but you are wanted quick at the
station. They are waiting for you. Go right
along, will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Only too glad to get away and comprehending
Scott&#8217;s ruse, Bucks exclaimed, &#8220;Why, of course,
certainly,&#8221; and stepping quickly into the crowd
walked away.</p>
<p>Turning again to Levake, Scott made no effort
to check the torrent of his words. In consequence,
the gambler found himself embarrassed
by the prospect of talking himself out. This
would not have been so bad except that his circle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
of admirers would, when he stopped talking, expect
him to do something and he was now at a
loss to decide just what to do. To shoot down
Bucks was rather a different matter from a pistol
duel with Scott.</p>
<p>None of the street loafers about the two men
knew Scott, nor did any of them know that Levake
had a prudent respect for Scott&#8217;s trigger.
As for Scott himself, a smile of contempt gradually
covered his face as he listened to Levake&#8217;s
outbreak. He only waited patiently for the moment,
which he knew must come, when Levake
should cease talking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your tongue, Levake,&#8221; returned Scott at last,
&#8220;is longer than a coyote&#8217;s. Why do you stand
here and bellow about being insulted? What is
all this noise about, anyway? These fellows,&#8221; a
contemptuous nod indicated the men standing
around, &#8220;all know, if you don&#8217;t. You&#8217;ve been
talking loud so you could get a crowd together
and advertise yourself by shooting an unarmed
boy, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The desperado broke out in fresh denials and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
curses, but he feared the ridicule of the Indian
would bring the laughter of his admirers down
on him. Nor was he keen to try a pistol duel.
He remembered too well the attack he had once
headed on an emigrant train that Scott was guarding,
and from which the outlaws with Levake had
carried away some unexpected and unwelcome
bullets.</p>
<p>Scott, now taunting Levake openly, stepped
directly in front of him. But the latter waved
him away. &#8220;I&#8217;ll settle my differences with you
when I&#8217;m ready,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;If that fellow,&#8221;
he added, indicating Bucks, who was making
record time across the square, &#8220;behaves himself,
I&#8217;ll let this go. If he doesn&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll fill him full of
lead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you do,&#8221; retorted Scott, &#8220;remember
just one thing&ndash;&ndash;that I&#8217;m going to fill you full,
Levake. Don&#8217;t forget that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott stepped backward. The crowd parted to
let him through and Levake walked sullenly toward
the cigar store.</p>
<p>Bucks wiped the perspiration from his forehead
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
when he reached the station and drew a long
breath. He waited until Scott crossed the square
and joined him. The Indian only laughed when
Bucks tried to thank him. &#8220;It is nothing,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;you are getting experience. Only don&#8217;t
tackle that man again till you give me notice
beforehand.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next morning Bucks installed himself at
Goose Creek.</p>
<p>Goose Creek was a mere operating point and
besides the rough wooden station, with an attic
sleeping-room for the operator, boasted only a
house for the section crew&ndash;&ndash;six men taken care of
by a China boy cook. East of the station stood
an old road ranch belonging to Leon Sublette.
For this, freight was at times unloaded and an Indian
trail to the south led through the sand-hills as
far as the Arickaree country. North of the river
greater sand-hills stretched as far as the eye could
reach. The long, marshy stretches of the Nebraska
River lost themselves on the eastern and
the western horizon and at times clouds of wild
fowl obscured the sun in their flight across the sky.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></div>
<p>Dancing came down to the new station to complete
the instalment of the instruments and this
broke for a day or two the loneliness of the new
surroundings. Indeed, there was hardly time to
be lonely. The constant round of interest attending
the arrival of trains with their long halts,
visits from trappers living at the ranch who were
always ready to talk, and occasional calls from
friendly Pawnees from the south, together with
abundance of time for hunting the geese and ducks,
made the days go.</p>
<p>But one early summer morning Bucks woke
to an adventure not upon his daily programme.
He walked downstairs after dressing, and as
he stepped out on the platform the sand-hills
touched by the rising sun shone in the northwest
like mountains of gold. Looking at them he saw
to his surprise they were covered with black
objects that appeared to be moving.</p>
<p>Indians were first in his mind, and in his alarm
he ran all the way to the section-house where the
foreman, after a hasty study of the hills, explained
that the suspicious-looking objects were buffaloes.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></div>
<p>This information only added to Bucks&#8217;s excitement.
The China boy cook, Lee Ong, at the
section-house appeared equally stirred at the
situation and, after running in and out of the
kitchen with much fluttering of cue and clattering
of wooden shoes, promised Bucks a buffalo
steak for dinner if he would bring in a hindquarter.</p>
<p>By the time Bucks had finished breakfast the
whole country to the north was black with buffaloes.
For hours they poured over the divide to
the delight of the astonished boy, and after a time
he wired Baxter at Medicine Bend that a herd of
at least one million buffaloes was crossing the railroad
at Goose Creek. As the grave despatcher
seemed not greatly excited by this intelligence,
Bucks followed up the story at intervals with
vivid details. A wag on the wire in Medicine
Bend played upon his enthusiasm by demanding
frequent bulletins, even going so far as to ask the
names of the leading buffaloes in the herd. When
he had got all the laughs possible for the office out
of the youthful operator, he wired Bucks that if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
the herd should linger too long on the right-of-way
he must notify them that they would be
held as trespassers.</p>
<p>This message had hardly reached Goose Creek
when the China boy came running into the telegraph
office. His eyes were staring, and his face
was greenish-white with fright. &#8220;Indians!&#8221; he
exclaimed, running to Bucks&#8217;s side and dashing
back again to the west window.</p>
<p>Bucks sprang to his feet. &#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee Ong pointed to the northern sand-hills.
Riding the broad slopes that led toward the river,
Bucks saw a long string of braves, evidently a
hunting party. The cook, beside himself with
fear, ran out of the station before Bucks could
stop him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi there, Lee,&#8221; cried the operator, running
after him. &#8220;Where are the section men?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone,&#8221; cried Lee Ong, not ceasing to run,
&#8220;all gone!&#8221; He pointed, with the words, to the
east.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell them to bring the hand-car down here!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too much gone,&#8221; shouted Ong. &#8220;Omaha!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Lee! Stop! Where are you going?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee stopped only long enough to throw his right
arm and forefinger with an excited gesture toward
the west.</p>
<p>&#8220;San Francisco, San Francisco!&#8221; he cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Lee,&#8221; exclaimed Bucks running after him,
&#8220;hold on! You are crazy! San Francisco is fifteen
hundred miles from here.&#8221; This information did
not visibly move Ong. &#8220;Indian no good,&#8221; he
cried, pausing, but only long enough to wave both
hands wildly toward the sand-hills. &#8220;San Francisco
good. No some more cook here. Indian
come too quick&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;Ong with his active finger girdled
the crown of his head in a lightning-like imitation
of a scalping knife&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;psst! No good for
Ong!&#8221;</p>
<p>It would have seemed funny to Bucks if he had
not been already frightened himself. But if the
section men had fled with the hand-car it meant
he would have to face the Indians. Lee Ong,
running like mad, was already out of hearing,
and in any event Bucks had no wish to imperil
the poor China boy&#8217;s scalp with his own.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></div>
<p>He turned an anxious eye toward the sand-hills.
Then realizing that on the platform he was exposing
himself needlessly, he hastened inside to his
key and called up Medicine Bend. It was only
a moment, but it seemed to the frightened operator
a lifetime before the despatcher answered.
Bucks reported the Indians and asked if there
were any freight trains coming that he could make
his escape on.</p>
<p>The despatcher answered that No. 11, the local
freight, was then due at Goose Creek and would
pick him up and carry him to Julesburg if he felt
in danger. Bucks turned with relief to the east
window and saw down the valley the smoke of the
freight already in sight. Never had a freight train
looked so good to his eyes as it did at that moment.
He hailed its appearance with a shout and
looked apprehensively back toward the sand-hills.</p>
<p>The activity in that direction was not reassuring.
The Indians, too, apparently had noticed
the smoke of No. 11 trailing on the horizon. A
conference followed, illustrated by frequent pointing
and violent gesticulating to indicate the coming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
train. Then with a sudden resolve the whole
party rode rapidly out of the hills and down toward
the railroad.</p>
<p>Bucks&#8217;s heart misgave him as he watched. But
the cotton-woods growing along the river hid the
Indians from his eyes and he could not surmise
what they were doing. The information all went
to the despatcher, however, who, more experienced,
scented serious mischief when Bucks&#8217;s bulletins
now came in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Watch close,&#8221; he wired. &#8220;It looks as if they
were going to attack the train.&#8221;</p>
<p>The operator&#8217;s anxiety rose with the intimation.
He ran out of doors and down the track,
but he could neither hear nor see a thing except
the slow-moving train with the smoke puffing from
the awkward, diamond-stack locomotive moving
peacefully toward the cotton-woods that fringed
the eastern shore of Goose Creek. The very silence
seemed ominous. Bucks knew the Indians
were hidden somewhere in the cotton-woods and
felt that they could mean nothing but mischief.
He ran back to his key and reported.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></div>
<p>&#8220;They will surely attack No. 11,&#8221; he wired.
&#8220;I will run across the bridge and warn them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are the Indians?&#8221; demanded the despatcher.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the timber across the creek. I am starting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be an idiot,&#8221; returned the despatcher,
with an expression of Western force and brevity.
&#8220;They will lift your hair before you get half-way
to the train. Stick to your key as long as you
can. If they start to cross the creek, leg it for
the ranch. Do you get me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucks, considerably flurried, answered that he
did, and the despatcher with renewed emphasis
reiterated his sharp inquiry. &#8220;Do you understand,
young fellow? If they start to cross the
creek, leg it for the ranch or you&#8217;ll lose your hair.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucks strained his eyes looking for a sign of
movement across the bridge. The cotton-woods
swayed gently in the light breeze, but revealed
nothing of what they hid.</p>
<p>The freight train continued to crawl lazily along,
its crews quite unconscious of any impending fate.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
Bucks, smothering with excitement and apprehension,
saw the engine round the curve that led to
the trestle approach of the bridge. Then the trees
hid the train from his sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are they doing?&#8221; demanded the despatcher,
growing apprehensive himself. An appalling
crash from the woods electrified Bucks,
and the key rattled fast.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have wrecked the train,&#8221; he wired without
an instant&#8217;s hesitation. &#8220;I can hear the crash
of cars falling from the trestle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before he could finish his message he heard also
the screech of an engine whistle. The next instant
the locomotive dashed out of the woods upon the
bridge at full speed and with cries of disappointment
and rage the savages rode out to the very
bank of the creek and into the water after it.
Bucks saw the sudden engine and thought at first
that the train had escaped. The next moment
he knew it had not. The engine was light: evidently
it had passed in safety the trap laid for
its destruction, but the cars following had left
the rails.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></div>
<p>If confirmation of this conclusion had been
needed, it came when he ran out upon the platform
as the engine approached. Bucks waved
vigorous signals at it, but the ponderous machine
came faster instead of slower as it neared the
station, and, with Bucks vainly trying to attract
the attention of the engineman or fireman, the
locomotive thundered past at forty miles an
hour.</p>
<p>He caught one glimpse through the tender gangway
as the engine dashed by and saw both men in
the cab crouching in front of the furnace door to
escape the fancied bullets of the savages. Bucks
shouted, but knew he had been neither seen nor
heard, and, as the engine raced into the west, his
best chance of escape from an unpleasant situation
had disappeared almost before he realized it.</p>
<p>Each detail was faithfully reported to the despatcher,
who answered at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Relief train,&#8221; he wired, &#8220;now making up with
a hundred men. Hold on as long as you can, but
take no chances. What are they doing? Can
you see or hear them?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></div>
<p>&#8220;They are yelling so you could hear them a
mile.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Scout around a little,&#8221; directed the despatcher,
&#8220;but don&#8217;t get caught.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucks scouted around the room a little, but did
not venture this time farther than the windows.
He was growing very nervous. And the Indians,
unrestrained in their triumph, displayed themselves
everywhere without concealment. Helpless
to aid, Bucks was compelled to stand and see a
fleeing white man, the brakeman of the doomed
train, running for his life, cut down by the pursuers
and scalped before his eyes.</p>
<p>The horror and savagery of it sank deeply into
the boy&#8217;s heart and only the realization of his
utter inability to help kept him quiet. Tears of
fury coursed down his cheeks as he saw in the
distance the murdered man lying motionless on the
sand beside the track, and with shaking fingers he
reported the death to Medicine Bend.</p>
<p>&#8220;The relief train has started,&#8221; answered the
despatcher, &#8220;with Stanley, Scott, Sublette, Dancing,
and a hundred men.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></div>
<p>As the message came, Bucks heard shooting farther
up the creek and this continued at intervals
for some moments. It was sickening to hear, for
it meant, Bucks surmised, that another trainman
was being murdered.</p>
<p>Meantime the Indians that he could see were
smashing into the wrecked merchandise cars and
dragging the loot out upon the open prairie. Hats,
clothing, tobacco, provisions, camp supplies of
every sort, and musical instruments, millinery,
boots, and blankets were among the plunder. The
wearing apparel was tumbled out of the broken
cases and, arrayed in whatever they could seize,
the Indians paraded on their horses up and down
the east bank of the creek in fantastic show.</p>
<p>Some wore women&#8217;s hats, some crinoline hoop-skirts
over their shoulders; others brandished
boots and shirts, and one glistening brave swung
a banjo at arm&#8217;s-length over his flying horse&#8217;s
head. Another party of the despoilers discovered
a shipment of silks and satins. These they
dragged in bolts from the packing-cases and, tying
one end of a bolt of silk to their ponies&#8217; tails, they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
raced, yelling, in circles around the prairie with
the parti-colored silks streaming behind, the bolts
bobbing and jerking along the ground like rioting
garlands of a crazy May-pole dance. And, having
exhausted their ingenuity and robed themselves
in this wise in all manner of plunder, they set
fire to the wrecked train, singing and dancing in
high glee as the flames rose crackling above the
trees.</p>
<p>Bucks, with clenched hands, watched and prayed
for the arrival of the speeding relief train. The
moments passed with leaden feet and the train
had many miles to come. The despatcher continued
his encouraging messages, but did not cease
his words of caution, and, as the wreckage burned,
Bucks perceived the Indians were riding in great
numbers up the creek. Too late he realized what
it meant. They were looking for the ford and
were about to cross to his side.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>
<p>He lost no time in sending a final word to the
despatcher before he started for safety, and his
call was sounding when he ran back to the key.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stanley&#8217;s train has passed Chimney Butte,&#8221;
said the despatcher. &#8220;Soon be with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Words over the wire never sounded better to the
frightened boy than those words.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Indians are crossing the creek,&#8221; Bucks
answered. &#8220;Am off for the ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>He closed the circuit and ran out on the platform.
The warriors had found the ford and the
horses of the head braves were already leading a
file across. Bucks threw one hurried look at them;
then, summoning his strength for an endurance
run, he started, with the station building between
him and the enemy, for the ranch.</p>
<p>He had hardly got under way when, as he
reached higher ground, he saw to his consternation
a party of Indians in the bottom land between
him and safety.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></div>
<p>He was cut off. Hoping that he had not been
seen, he threw himself flat on the ground and,
turning about, crawled, behind a slight ridge that
afforded concealment, stealthily back toward
the station. The Indians up the creek had
crossed, but were riding away from the station
and toward the ranch, evidently bent on attacking
it next. The flames from the burning train
rose high above the creek. There seemed no
place to escape to and Bucks, creeping through
the sedge grass, got back to his key and called
the despatcher.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cut off from the ranch by a second party of
Indians. Will wait here for the train&ndash;&ndash;where is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>A moment passed before the answer came.
&#8220;Less than ten miles from you. Passed Driftwood
Station at ten-forty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucks looked at his clock. Driftwood was ten
miles west. The hands stood at ten-forty-eight.
Surely, he concluded, they will be here by eleven
o&#8217;clock. Could he hold the station for twelve
minutes? Even a show of force he knew would
halt the Indians for an interval.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></div>
<p>He hastily pushed such packages of freight as
lay in the store-room up to the various windows,
as slight barricades behind which he could hide
to shoot, and with much effort got the largest
packing-case against the platform door so they
could not rush him from the creek side. For the
twentieth time he looked over his revolver, placed
a little store of cartridges behind each shelter, and
peered again out of the windows. To his horror
he perceived that the two parties had joined and
were riding in a great half-circle down on the
station. Evidently the Indians were coming after
him before they attacked the ranch. He reported
to the despatcher, and an answer came instantly.
&#8220;Stanley should be within five miles. How close
are they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Less than half a mile.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you got a gun?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucks wired, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you use it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Expect I&#8217;ll have to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shoot the minute they get within range.
Never mind whether you hit anybody, bang away.
What are they doing?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></div>
<p>Bucks ran around the room to look. &#8220;Closing
in,&#8221; he answered briefly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you see the train?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucks fixed his eyes upon the western horizon.
He never had tried so hard in his life to see anything.
Yet the sunshine reflected no sign of a
friendly smoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing in sight,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;I can&#8217;t hold
out much longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hastily closing his key he ran to the south window.
A dozen Indians, beating the alder bushes as
they advanced, doubtless suspecting that he lay
concealed in them, were now closest. He realized
that by his very audacity in returning to the
building he had gained a few precious moments.
But the nearest Indians had already reached open
ground, two hundred yards away, and through
their short, yelping cries and their halting on the
edge of the brake, he understood they were debating
how he had escaped and wondering whether
he had gone back into the station. He lay behind
some sacks of flour watching his foes closely.
Greatly to his surprise, his panic had passed and
he felt collected. He realized that he was fighting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
for his life and meant to sell it as dearly as
possible. And he had resolved to shoot the instant
they started toward him.</p>
<p>From the table he heard the despatcher&#8217;s call,
but he no longer dared answer it. The Indians,
with a war-whoop, urged their ponies ahead and
a revolver shot rang from the station window.
It was followed almost instantly by a second and
a third. The Indians ducked low on their horses&#8217;
necks and, wheeling, made for the willows. In
the quick dash for cover one horse stumbled and
threw his rider. The animal bolted and the Indian,
springing to his feet, ran like a deer after his
companions, but he did not escape unscathed.
Two shots followed him from the station, and the
Indian, falling with a bullet in his thigh, dragged
himself wounded into hiding.</p>
<p>A chorus of cries from far and near heralded the
opening of the encounter. Enraged by the repulse,
a larger number of Indians riding in opened
fire on the station and Bucks found himself target
for a fusillade of bullets. But protected by his
barricades he was only fearful of a charge, for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
when the Indians should start to rush the station
he felt all would be over.</p>
<p>While he lay casting up his chances, and discharging
his revolver at intervals to make a showing,
the fire of the Indians slackened. This, Bucks
felt, boded no good, and reckless of his store of
cartridges he continued to blaze away whenever
he could see a bush moving.</p>
<p>It was at this moment that he heard the despatcher
calling him, and a message followed. &#8220;If
you are alive, answer me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucks ran to the key. The situation was hopeless.
No train was in sight as he pressed his fingers
on the button for the last time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stopped their first advance and wounded one.
They are going to charge&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He heard a sharp chorus outside and, feeling
what it meant, sent his last word: &#8220;Good-by.&#8221;
From three sides of the open ground around the
building the Indians were riding down upon him.
Firing as fast as he could with any accuracy, he
darted from window to window, reaching the west
window last. As he looked out he saw up the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
valley the smoke of the approaching train and
understood from the fury of his enemies that they,
too, had seen it. But the sight of the train now
completely unnerved him. To lose his life with
help a few moments away was an added bitterness,
and he saw that the relief train would be too
late to save him.</p>
<p>He fired the last cartridge in his hot revolver
at the circling braves and, as he reloaded, the Indians
ran up on the platform and threw themselves
against the door. Fiendish faces peered through
the window-panes and one Indian smashed a sash
in with a war club.</p>
<p>Bucks realized that his reloading was useless.
The cartridges were, in fact, slipping through his
fingers, when, dropping his revolver, he drew Bob
Scott&#8217;s knife and backed up against the inner
office door, just as a warrior brandishing a hatchet
sprang at him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>
<p>Before Bucks had time to think, a second Indian
had sprung through the open window. A feeling
of helpless rage swept over him at being cornered,
defenceless; and, expecting every instant to
be despatched with no more consideration than if
he had been a rat, he stood at bay, determined not
to be taken alive.</p>
<p>For an instant his mind worked clearly and with
the rapidity of lightning. His life swept before
him as if he were a drowning man. In that horrible
moment he even heard his call clicking from
the despatcher. Of the two Indians confronting
him, half-naked and shining with war-paint, one
appeared more ferocious than the other, and
Bucks only wondered which would attack first.</p>
<p>He had not long to wait. The first brave raised
a war club to brain him. As Bucks&#8217;s straining eye
followed the movement, the second Indian struck
the club down. Bucks understood nothing from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
the action. The quick, guttural words that followed,
the sharp dispute, the struggle of the first
savage to evade the second and brain the white
boy in spite of his antagonist&ndash;&ndash;a lithe, active Indian
of great strength who held the enraged warrior
back&ndash;&ndash;all of this, Bucks, bewildered, could
understand nothing of. The utmost he could surmise
was that the second warrior, from his dress
and manner of authority perhaps a chief, meant
to take him alive for torture. He watched the
contest between the two Indians until with force
and threats the chief had driven the warrior outside
and turned again upon him.</p>
<p>It was then that Bucks, desperate, hurled himself
knife in hand at the chief to engage him in
final combat. The Indian, though surprised, met
his onset skilfully and before Bucks could realize
what had occurred he had been disarmed and
tossed like a child half-way across the room.</p>
<p>Before he could move, the chief was standing
over him. &#8220;Stop!&#8221; he exclaimed, catching Bucks&#8217;s
arm in a grip of steel as the latter tried to drag
down his antagonist. &#8220;I am Iron Hand. Does a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
boy fight me?&#8221; he demanded with contempt in
every word. &#8220;See your knife.&#8221; He pointed to
the floor. &#8220;When I was wounded by the
Cheyennes you gave me venison. You have forgotten;
but the Sioux is not like the white man&ndash;&ndash;Iron
Hand does not forget.&#8221;</p>
<p>A fusillade of shots and a babel of yelling from
outside interrupted his words. The chief paid no
attention to the uproar. &#8220;Your soldiers are here.
The building is on fire, but you are safe. I am
Iron Hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>So saying, and before Bucks could find his
tongue, the chief strode to the rear window, with
one blow of his arm smashed out the whole sash,
and springing lightly through the crashing glass,
disappeared.</p>
<p>Bucks, panting with confusion, sprang to his
feet. Smoke already poured in from the freight
room, and the crackling of flames and the sounds
of the fighting outside reminded Bucks of Iron
Hand&#8217;s words. He ran to the door.</p>
<p>The train had pulled up within a hundred feet
of the station and the railroad men in the coaches
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
were pouring a fire upon the Indians, under the
cover of which scouts were unloading, down a hastily
improvised chute, their horses, together with
those of such troopers as had been gathered hurriedly.</p>
<p>Bucks ran back into the office and opening his
wooden chest threw into it what he could of his
effects and tried to drag it from the burning
building out upon the platform. As he struggled
with the unwieldy box, two men ran up from
the train toward him, staring at him as if he
had been a ghost. He recognized Stanley and
Dancing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you hurt?&#8221; cried Stanley hastening to his
side.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; exclaimed Bucks, his head still swimming,
&#8220;but everything will be burned.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How in the name of God, boy, have you
escaped?&#8221; demanded Stanley, as he clenched
Bucks&#8217;s shoulder in his hand. Dancing seized
the cumbersome chest and dragged it out of
danger. The Indians, jeering, as they retreated,
at the railroad men, made no attempt to continue
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
the attack, but rode away content with the destruction
of the train and the station.</p>
<p>Stanley, assured of Bucks&#8217;s safety, though he
wasted no time in waiting for an explanation of
it, directed the men to save what they could out
of the station&ndash;&ndash;it was too late to save the building&ndash;&ndash;and
hurried away to see to the unloading of
the horses.</p>
<p>Bill Dancing succeeded in rescuing the telegraph
instruments and with Bucks&#8217;s help he got the
wires rigged upon a cracker-box outside where the
operator could report the story to the now desperate
despatcher. The scouts and troopers were
already in the saddle and, leading the way for the
men, gave chase across the bottoms to the Indians.</p>
<p>Bob Scott, riding past Bucks reined up for a
moment. &#8220;Got pretty warm for you, Bucks&ndash;&ndash;eh?
How did you get through?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucks jumped toward him. &#8220;Bob!&#8221; he exclaimed,
grasping his arm. &#8220;It was Iron Hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Iron Hand!&#8221; echoed Bob, lifting his eyebrows.
&#8220;Brul&eacute;s, then. It will be a long chase. What did
he say?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Why, we talked pretty fast,&#8221; stammered
Bucks. &#8220;He spoke about the venison but never
said a blamed word about my fixing his arm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob laughed as he struck his horse and galloped
on to pass the news to Stanley. A detail was
left to clear the cotton-woods across the creek
and guard the railroad men against possible attack
while clearing the wreck. The body of the unfortunate
brakeman was brought across the bridge
and laid in the baggage car and a tent was pitched
to serve as a temporary station for Bucks.</p>
<p>While this was being done, Bob Scott, who had
ridden farthest up the creek, appeared leading his
horse and talking to a white man who was walking
beside him. He had found the conductor of the
wrecked train, Pat Francis, who, young though
he was, had escaped the Indians long enough to
reach a cave in the creek bank and whose rifle
shots Bucks had heard, while Francis was holding
the Sioux at bay during the fight. The plucky
conductor, who was covered with dust, was
greeted with acclamations.</p>
<p>&#8220;He claims,&#8221; volunteered Scott, speaking to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
Stanley, &#8220;he could have stood them off all
day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Francis&#8217;s eyes fell regretfully on the dead brakeman.
&#8220;If that boy had minded what I said and
come with me he would have been alive now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The wrecking train, with a gang of men from
Medicine Bend, arrived late in the afternoon, and
at supper-time a courier rode in from Stanley&#8217;s
scouting party with despatches for General Park.
Stanley reported the chase futile. As Bob Scott
had predicted, the Brul&eacute;s had burned the ranch
and craftily scattered the moment they reached
the sand-hills. Instead of a single trail to follow,
Stanley found fifty. Only his determination to give
the Indians a punishment that they would remember
held the pursuing party together, and three days
afterward he fought a battle with the wily raiders,
surprised in a canyon on the Frenchman River,
which, though indecisive, gave Iron Hand&#8217;s band
a wholesome respect for the stubborn engineer.</p>
<p>The train service under the attacks of the Indians
thus repeated, fell into serious demoralization,
and an armed guard of regular soldiers rode all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
trains for months after the Goose Creek attack.
Bucks was given a guard for his own lonely and
exposed position in the person of Bob Scott, the
man of all men the young operator would have
wished for. And at intervals he read from his
favorite novel to the scout, who still questioned
whether it was a true story.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>
<p>With Bob Scott to lead an occasional hunting
trip, Bucks found the time go fast at Goose Creek
and no excitement came again until later in the
summer.</p>
<p>Where Goose Creek breaks through the sand-hills
the country is flat, and, when swollen with
spring rains, the stream itself has the force and
fury of a mountain river. Then summer comes;
the rain clouds hang no longer over the Black
Hills, continuing sunshine parches the face of the
great plains, and the rushing and turbulent Goose
Creek ignominiously evaporates&ndash;&ndash;either ascending
to the skies in vapor or burrowing obscurely under
the sprawling sands that lie within its course.
Only stagnant pools and feeble rivulets running
in widely separated channels&ndash;&ndash;hiding under osiers
or lurking within shady stretches of a friendly
bank&ndash;&ndash;remain to show where in April the noisy
Goose engulfs everything within reach of its foaming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
wings. The creek bed becomes in midsummer
a mere sandy ford that may be crossed by a
child&ndash;&ndash;a dry map that prints the running feet of
snipe and plover, the creeping tread of the mink
and the muskrat, and the slouching trail of the
coyote and the wolf.</p>
<p>Yet there is treachery in the Goose even in its
apparent repose, and the unwary emigrant sometimes
comes to grief upon its treacherous bed.
The sands of the Goose have swallowed up more
than one heedless buffalo, and the Indian knows
them too well to trust them at all.</p>
<p>When the railroad bridge was put across the
creek, the difficulties of securing it were very considerable
and Brodie, the chief engineer, was in
the end forced to rely upon temporary foundations.
Trainmen and engineers for months carried
&#8220;slow&#8221; orders for Goose Creek bridge, and
Bucks grew weary with warnings from the despatchers
to careless enginemen about crossing it.</p>
<p>Among the worst offenders in running his engine
too fast over Goose Creek bridge was Dan
Baggs, who, breathing fire through his bristling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
red whiskers and flashing it from his watery blue
eyes, feared nobody but Indians, and obeyed reluctantly
everybody connected with the railroad.
Moreover, he never hesitated to announce that
when &#8220;they didn&#8217;t like the way he ran his engine
they could get somebody else to run it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Baggs&#8217;s great failing was that, while he often ran
his train too fast, he wasted so much time at stations
that he was always late. And it was said of
him that the only instance in which he ever reached
the end of his division on time was the day he ran
away from Iron Hand&#8217;s band of Sioux at Goose
Creek&ndash;&ndash;on that occasion he had made, without a
doubt, a record run.</p>
<p>But when, one hot afternoon in August, Baggs
left Medicine Bend with a light engine for Fort
Park, where he was to pick up a train-load of ties,
he had no thought of making further pioneer railroad
history. His engine had been behaving so
well that his usual charges of inefficiency against
it had not for a long time been registered with the
roundhouse foreman, and Dan Baggs, dreaming in
the heat and sunshine of nothing worse than losing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
his scalp to the Indians or winning a fortune
at cards&ndash;&ndash;gambling was another of his failings&ndash;&ndash;was
pounding lightly along over the rails when
he reached, without heeding it, Goose Creek
bridge.</p>
<p>There were those who averred that after his
experience with Iron Hand he always ran faster
across the forbidden bridge than anywhere else.
On this occasion Baggs bowled merrily along the
trestle and was getting toward the middle of the
river when the pony trucks jumped the rail and
the drivers dropped on the ties. Dan Baggs yelled
to his fireman.</p>
<p>It was unnecessary. Delaroo, the fireman, a
quiet but prudent fellow, was already standing in
the gangway prepared for an emergency. He
sprang, not a minute too soon, from the engine
and lighted in the sand. But Dan Baggs&#8217;s fixed
habit of being behind time chained him to his
seat an instant too long. The bulky engine, with
its tremendous impetus, shot from the trestle and
plunged like a leviathan clear of the bridge and
down into the wet sand of the creek-bed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></div>
<p>The fireman scrambled to his feet and ran forward,
expecting to find his engineman hurt or
killed. What was his surprise to behold Baggs,
uninjured, on his feet and releasing the safety-valve
of his fallen locomotive to prevent an explosion.
The engine lay on its side. The crash
of the breaking timbers, followed by a deafening
blast of escaping steam, startled Bucks and, with
Bob Scott, he ran out of the station. As he saw
the spectacle in the river, he caught his breath.
He lived to see other wrecks&ndash;&ndash;some appalling
ones&ndash;&ndash;but this was his first, and the shock of seeing
Dan Baggs&#8217;s engine lying prone in the river,
trumpeting forth a cloud of steam, instead of
thundering across the bridge as he normally saw
it every day, was an extraordinary one.</p>
<p>Filled with alarm, he ran toward the bridge
expecting that the worst had happened to the
engineman and fireman. But his amazement
grew rather than lessened when he saw Delaroo
and Baggs running for their lives toward him.
He awaited them uneasily.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; demanded Bucks, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
Baggs, well in the lead, came within hailing distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Matter!&#8221; panted Baggs, not slackening his
pace. &#8220;Matter! Look at my engine! Indians!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indians, your grandmother!&#8221; retorted Bob
Scott mildly. &#8220;There&#8217;s not an Indian within
forty miles&ndash;&ndash;what&#8217;s the matter with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They wrecked us, Bob,&#8221; declared Baggs,
pointing to his roaring engine; &#8220;see for yourself,
man. Them cotton-woods are full of Indians
right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Full of rabbits!&#8221; snorted Bob Scott. &#8220;You
wrecked yourself by running too fast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Delaroo,&#8221; demanded Dan Baggs, pointing
dramatically at his taciturn fireman, who had
now overtaken him, &#8220;how fast was I running?&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter Delaroo, an Indian half-blood himself, returned
a disconcerting answer. &#8220;As fast as you
could, I reckon.&#8221; He understood at once that
Baggs had raised a false alarm to protect himself
from blame for the accident, and resented being
called upon to support an absurd story.</p>
<p>Baggs stood his ground. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t find an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
Indian has done this,&#8221; he asserted, addressing
Bob Scott with indignation, &#8220;you can have my
pay check.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; returned Bob, meditatively. &#8220;I reckon
an Indian did it, but you are the Indian.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, stop your gabble, you boys!&#8221; blustered
the doughty engineman, speaking to everybody
and with a show of authority. &#8220;Bucks, notify
the despatcher I&#8217;m in the river.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get back to your engine, then,&#8221; said Scott.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask Bucks to send in a false report. And
afterward,&#8221; suggested Scott, &#8220;you and I, Dan,
can go over and clean the Indians out of the
cotton-woods.&#8221;</p>
<p>Baggs took umbrage at the suggestion, and no
amount of chaffing from Scott disconcerted him,
but after Bucks reported the catastrophe to Medicine
Bend the wires grew warm. Baxter was very
angry. A crew was got together at Medicine
Bend, and a wrecking-train made up with a
gang of bridge and track men and despatched to
the scene of the disaster. The operating department
was so ill equipped to cope with any kind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
of a wreck that it was after midnight before
the train got under way.</p>
<p>The sun had hardly risen next morning, when
Bob Scott, without any words of explanation, ran
into Bucks&#8217;s room, woke him hurriedly, and, bidding
him dress quickly, ran out. It took only a
minute for Bucks to spring from his cot and get
into his clothes and he hastened out of doors to
learn what the excitement was about. Scott was
walking fast down toward the bridge. Bucks
joined him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Bob?&#8221; he asked hastily. &#8220;Indians?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indians?&#8221; echoed Bob scornfully. &#8220;I guess
not this time. I&#8217;ve heard of Indians stealing
pretty nearly everything on earth&ndash;&ndash;but not this.
No Indian in this country, not even Turkey Leg,
ever stole a locomotive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean Dan Baggs&#8217;s engine is gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucks&#8217;s face turned blank with amazement.
&#8220;Gone?&#8221; he echoed incredulously. He looked at
Scott with reproach. &#8220;You are joking me.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></div>
<p>&#8220;See if you can find it,&#8221; returned Scott tersely.</p>
<p>As they hastened on, Bucks looked to the spot
where the engine had lain the night before. It
was no longer there.</p>
<p>He was too stunned to ask further questions.
The two strode along the ties in silence. Eagerly
Bucks ran to the creek bank and scanned more
closely the sandy bed. It was there that the
wrecked engine and tender had lain the night before.
The sand showed no disturbance whatever.
It was as smooth as a table. But nothing was to
be seen of the engine or tender. These had disappeared
as completely as if an Aladdin&#8217;s slave, at
his master&#8217;s bidding, had picked them from their
resting place and set them on top of some distant
sand-hill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bob,&#8221; demanded Bucks, breathless, &#8220;what
does it mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It means the company is out one brand-new
locomotive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what has happened?&#8221; asked Bucks, rubbing
his eyes to make sure he was not dreaming.
&#8220;Where is the engine?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></div>
<p>Scott pointed to the spot where the engine had
lain. &#8220;It is in that quicksand,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>The engine, during the night, had, in fact, sunk
completely into the sand. No trace was left of
it or of its tender. Not a wheel or cab corner
remained to explain; all had mysteriously and
completely disappeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Great Heavens, Bob!&#8221; exclaimed Bucks.
&#8220;How will they <i>ever</i> get it out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The only way they&#8217;ll ever get it out, I reckon,
is by keeping Dan Baggs digging there till he digs
it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dan Baggs never could dig that out&ndash;&ndash;how
long would it take him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About a hundred and seventy-five years.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Scott spoke, the two heard footsteps behind
them. Baggs and Delaroo, who had slept
at the section-house, were coming down the track.
&#8220;Baggs,&#8221; said Scott ironically, as the sleepy-looking
engineman approached, &#8220;you were right
about the Indians being in the cotton-woods last
night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew I was right,&#8221; exclaimed Baggs, nodding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
rapidly and brusquely. &#8220;Next time you&#8217;ll
take a railroad man&#8217;s word, I guess. Where are
they?&#8221; he added, looking apprehensively around.
&#8220;What have they done?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They have stolen your engine,&#8221; answered Scott
calmly. He pointed to the river bed. Baggs
stared; then running along the bank he looked
up-stream and down and came back sputtering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&ndash;&ndash;what&ndash;&ndash;how&ndash;&ndash;what in time! Where&#8217;s
the engine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indians,&#8221; remarked Scott sententiously, looking
wisely down upon the sphinx-like quicksand.
&#8220;Indians, Dan. They must have loaded the engine
on their ponies during the night&ndash;&ndash;did you
hear anything?&#8221; he demanded, turning to Bucks.
Bucks shook his head. &#8220;I thought I did,&#8221; continued
Scott. &#8220;Thought I heard something&ndash;&ndash;what&#8217;s
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Baggs jumped. All were ready to be startled
at anything&ndash;&ndash;for even Scott, in spite of his irony,
had been as much astounded as any one at the
first sight of the empty bed of sand. It was
enough to make any one feel queerish. The noise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
they heard was the distant rumble of the wrecking-train.</p>
<p>In the east the sun was bursting over the sand-hills
into a clear sky. Bucks ran to the station to
report the train and the disappearance of the engine.
When he had done this he ran back to the
bridge. The wrecking-train had pulled up near
at hand and the greater part of the men, congregated
in curious groups on the bridge, were
talking excitedly and watching several men down
on the sand, who with spades were digging vigorously
about the spot which Baggs and Delaroo
indicated as the place where the engine had fallen.
Others from time to time joined them, as they
scraped out wells and trenches in the moist sand.
These filled with water almost as rapidly as they
were opened.</p>
<p>Urged by their foreman, a dozen additional men
joined the toilers. They dug in lines and in circles,
singly and in squads, broadening their field of
prospecting as the laughter and jeers of their companions
watching from the bridge spurred them to
further toil. But not the most diligent of their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
efforts brought to light a single trace of the missing
engine.</p>
<p>The wrecking crew was mystified. Many refused
to believe the engine had ever fallen off the
bridge. But there was the broken track! They
could not escape the evidence of their eyes, even
if they did scoff at the united testimony of the
two men that had been on the engine when it
leaped from the bridge and the two that had afterward
seen it lying in the sand.</p>
<p>The track and bridge men without more ado
set to work to repair the damage done the track
and bridge. A volley of messages came from
head-quarters. At noon a special car, with Colonel
Stanley and the division heads arrived to
investigate.</p>
<p>The digging was planned and directed on a
larger scale and resumed with renewed vigor.
Sheet piling was attempted. Every expedient was
resorted to that Stanley&#8217;s scientific training could
suggest to bring to light the buried treasure&ndash;&ndash;for
an engine in those days, and so far from locomotive
works, was very literally a treasure to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
railroad company. Stanley himself was greatly
upset. He paced the ties above where the men
were digging, directing and encouraging them doggedly,
but very red in the face and contemplating
the situation with increasing vexation. He stuck
persistently to the work till darkness set in. Meantime,
the track had been opened and the wrecking-train
crossed the bridge and took the passing track.
The moon rose full over the broad valley and the
silent plains. Men still moved with lanterns under
the bridge. Bucks, after a hard day&#8217;s work
at the key, was invited for supper to Stanley&#8217;s
car, where the foremen had assembled to lay new
plans for the morrow. But Bob Scott, when Bucks
told him, shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are wasting their work,&#8221; he murmured.
&#8220;The company is &#8216;out.&#8217; That engine is half-way
to China by this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>It might, at least, as well have been, as far as
the railroad company was concerned. The digging
and sounding and scraping proved equally useless.
The men dug down almost as deep as the piling
that supported the bridge itself&ndash;&ndash;it was in vain.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
In the morning the sun smiled at their efforts and
again at night the moon rose mysteriously upon
them, and in the distant sand-hills a thousand coyotes
yelped a requiem for the lost locomotive.
But no human eye ever saw so much as a bolt of
the great machine again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>
<p>The loss of the engine at Goose Creek brought
an unexpected relief to Bucks. His good work in
the emergency earned for him a promotion. He
was ordered to report to Medicine Bend for assignment,
and within a week a new man appeared
at Goose Creek to relieve him.</p>
<p>There was little checking up to do. Less than
thirty minutes gave Bucks time to answer all of
his successor&#8217;s questions and pack his trunk. He
might have slept till morning and taken a passenger
train to Medicine Bend, but the prospect of
getting away from Goose Creek at once was too
tempting to dismiss. A freight train of bridge
timbers pulled across the bridge just as Bucks was
ready to start. Pat Francis, the doughty conductor,
who, single-handed, had held Iron Hand&#8217;s
braves at bay, was in charge of the train. He offered
Bucks a bench and blanket in the caboose
for the night, and promised to have him in Medicine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
Bend in the morning; Bucks, nothing loath,
accepted. His trunk was slung aboard and the
train pulled out for Medicine Bend.</p>
<p>The night proved unseasonably cold. Francis
built a blazing fire in the caboose stove and afterward
shared his hearty supper with his guest.
As the train thundered and rumbled slowly over
the rough track, the conductor, while Bucks
stretched out on the cushions, entertained him
with stories of his experiences on the railroad
frontier&ndash;&ndash;not suspecting that before morning he
should furnish for his listener one of the strangest
of them.</p>
<p>Bucks curled up in his blanket late, but, in spite
of unaccustomed surroundings and the pitch and
lurch of the caboose, which was hardly less than
the tossing of a ship in a gale, Bucks dozed while
his companion and the brakeman watched. The
latter, a large, heavy fellow, was a busy man, as
the calls for brakes&ndash;&ndash;and only hand-brakes were
then known&ndash;&ndash;were continual. There were no other
passengers, and except for the frequent blasts of
the engine whistle the night passed quietly enough.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></div>
<p>Bucks dreamed of fighting bears with Scuffy,
and found himself repeatedly rolling down precipitous
mountains without landing successfully
anywhere. Then he quieted into a heavy, unbroken
sleep and found himself among the hills
of Alleghany, hunting rabbits that were constantly
changing into antelope and escaping him. Fatigued
with his unceasing efforts, he woke.</p>
<p>A gray light, half dusk, revealed the outlines of
the cab interior, as he opened his eyes, and a thundering,
rumbling sound that rang in his ears and
seemed everywhere about him cleared his mind
and brought him back to his situation.</p>
<p>It was cold, and he looked at the stove. The
fire was out. On the opposite side of the cab the
brakeman lay on the cushions fast asleep. Outside,
the thundering noises came continuously from
everywhere at once. It did not occur to Bucks
that the caboose was standing still. It trembled
and vibrated more or less, but he noticed there
was no longer any lurching and thought they had
reached remarkably smooth track. They were
certainly not standing still, he assured himself, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
he rubbed his eyes to wake up. But perhaps they
might be in the yards at Medicine Bend, with
other trains rolling past them.</p>
<p>Somewhat confused he raised the curtain of the
window near him. The sky was overcast and day
was breaking. He rose higher on his elbow to
look more carefully. Everywhere that his eye
could reach toward the horizon the earth seemed
in motion, rising and falling in great waves. Was
it an earthquake? He rubbed his eyes. It seemed
as if everywhere thousands of heads were tossing,
and from this continual tossing and trampling
came the thunder and vibration. Moreover, the
caboose was not moving; of this he felt sure.
Amazed, and only half-awake, he concluded that
the train must have left the track and dropped
into a river. The uncertainty of his vision was
due, he now saw, to a storm that had swept the
plains. It was blowing, with a little snow, and in
the midst of the snow the mysterious waves were
everywhere rising and falling.</p>
<p>Bucks put the curtain completely aside. The
sound of his feet striking the floor aroused the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
conductor, who rose from his cushion with a
start. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been asleep,&#8221; he exclaimed, rubbing
his eyes. &#8220;Where are we, Bucks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what I am trying to figure out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the brakeman?&#8221; demanded Francis.
As he asked the question he saw the big fellow
asleep in the corner. Francis shook him roughly.
&#8220;That comes of depending on some one else,&#8221; he
muttered to Bucks. &#8220;I went to sleep on his promise
to watch for an hour&ndash;&ndash;he knew I had been up
all last night and told me to take a nap. You
see what happened. The moment I went to
sleep, he went to sleep,&#8221; exclaimed Francis in disgust.
&#8220;Wake up!&#8221; he continued brusquely to
the drowsy brakeman. &#8220;Where are we? What
have we stopped for? What&#8217;s all this noise?&#8221;
Though he asked the questions fast, he expected
no answer to any of them from the confused trainman
and waited for none. Instead, he threw up
a curtain and looked out. &#8220;Thunder and guns!
Buffaloes!&#8221; he cried, and seizing his lantern ran
out of the caboose door and climbed the roof-ladder.
Bucks was fast upon his heels.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></div>
<p>The freight train stood upon a wide plain and
in the midst of thousands of buffaloes travelling
south. As far as their eyes could reach in all
directions, the astonished railroad men beheld a
sea of moving buffaloes. Without further delay
Francis, followed by Bucks, started along the running
boards for the head end of the train.</p>
<p>The conductor found his train intact; but when
he reached the head end he could find neither
engine, tender, nor crew. All had disappeared.
Running down the ladder of the head box-car, the
conductor examined the draw-bar for evidence of
an accident. The coupling was apparently uninjured
but the tender and engine were gone.
Francis, more upset than Bucks had ever seen
him, or ever afterward saw him, walked moodily
back to the caboose. What humiliated him more
than the strange predicament in which he found
himself was that he had trusted to a subordinate
and gone to sleep in his caboose while on duty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Serves me right,&#8221; he muttered, knitting his
brows. &#8220;Brakeman,&#8221; he added sternly, &#8220;take
your lantern and flags and get out behind. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
minute the buffaloes get across the track, go back
two hundred yards and protect us. I will watch
the head end. While these buffaloes are crossing
they will be protection enough. Soon as it is
daylight we will find out where we are.&#8221;</p>
<p>The snow continued falling and the buffaloes
drifted south with the storm, which was squally.
Every moment, as the sky and landscape lightened,
Francis, whom Bucks had followed forward, expected
to see the last of the moving herd. But an
hour passed and a second hour without showing
any gaps in the enormous fields. And the brighter
the daylight grew, the more buffaloes they could
see.</p>
<p>Francis stormed at the situation, but he could
do nothing. Finally, and as hope was deserting
him, he heard the distant tooting of an engine
whistle. It grew louder and louder until Bucks
could hear the ringing of a bell and the hissing
of the open cylinder cocks of a slow-moving
locomotive. Gaps could now be discerned in the
great herds of buffaloes, and through the blowing
snow the uncertain outlines of the backing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
engine could dimly be seen. Francis angrily
watched the approaching engine, and, as soon as
it had cleared the last of the stumbling buffaloes
on the track, he walked forward to meet it and
greeted the engineman roughly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by setting my train out
here on the main track in the middle of the night?&#8221;
he demanded ferociously, and those that knew Pat
Francis never wanted to add to his anger when
it was aroused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get excited,&#8221; returned Dan Baggs calmly,
for it was the redoubtable Baggs who held the
throttle. &#8220;I found I was getting short of water.
We are just coming to Blackwood Hill and I knew
I could never make Blackwood Siding with the
train. So I uncoupled and ran to the Blackwood
tank for water. We are all right now. Couple us
up. If I hadn&#8217;t got water, we should have been
hung up here till we got another engine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even so,&#8221; retorted Francis, &#8220;you needn&#8217;t have
been all night about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But when we started back there were about
ten million buffaloes on the track. If I had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
heading into them with the cow-catcher I shouldn&#8217;t
have been afraid. But I had to back into them,
and if I had crippled one it would have upset the
tender.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Back her up,&#8221; commanded Francis curtly,
&#8220;and pull us out of here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meantime there was much excitement at the
despatchers&#8217; office in Medicine Bend over the lost
train. It had been reported out of White Horse
Station on time, and had not reported at Blackwood.
For hours the despatcher waited vainly
for some word from the bridge timbers. When
the train reported at Blackwood Station, the
message of Francis explaining the cause of the
tie-up seemed like a voice from the tombs. But
the strain was relieved and the train made fast
time from Blackwood in. About nine o&#8217;clock in
the morning it whistled for the Medicine Bend
yards and a few moments later Bucks ran upstairs
in the station building to report for assignment.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>
<p>He found Baxter needing a man in the office, and
Bucks was asked to substitute until Collins, the
despatcher who was ill, could take his trick again.
This brought Bucks where he was glad to be, directly
under Stanley&#8217;s eye, but it brought also
new responsibilities, and opened his mind to the
difficulties of operating a new and already over-taxed
line in the far West, where reliable men and
available equipment were constantly at a premium.</p>
<p>The problem of getting and keeping good men
was the hardest that confronted the operating
department, and the demoralization of the railroad
men from the life in Medicine Bend grew
steadily worse as the new town attracted additional
parasites. When Bucks, after his return,
took his first walk after supper up Front Street,
he was not surprised at this. Medicine Bend was
more than ten times as noisy, and if it were possible
to add any vice to its viciousness this, too, it
would seem, had been done.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></div>
<p>As was his custom, he walked to the extreme
end of Front Street and turning started back for
the station, when he encountered Baxter, the chief
despatcher. Baxter saw Bucks first and spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you were taking your sleep at this
time,&#8221; returned Bucks, greeting him.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I should be,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;but we are in
trouble. Dan Baggs is to take out the passenger
train to-night, and no one can find him. He is
somewhere up here in one of these dives and has
forgotten all about his engine. It is enough to
set a man crazy to have to run trains with such
cattle. Bucks, suppose you take one side of the
street while I take the other, and help me hunt
him up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall we do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look in every door all the way down-street
till we find him. If we don&#8217;t get the fellow on his
engine, there will be no train out till midnight.
Say nothing to anybody and answer no questions;
just find him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Baxter started down the right-hand side of the
long street and Bucks took the left-hand side. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
was queer business for Bucks, and the sights that
met him at every turn were enough to startle one
stouter than he. He controlled his disgust and
ignored the questions sometimes hurled at him by
drunken men and women, intent only on getting
his eye on the irresponsible Baggs.</p>
<p>Half-way down toward the square he reached a
dance hall. The doors were spread wide open and
from within came a din of bad music, singing, and
noise of every kind.</p>
<p>Bucks entered the place with some trepidation.
In the rear of the large room was a raised platform
extending the entire width of it. At one end
of the platform stood a piano which a man pounded
incessantly and fiercely. Other performers were
singing and dancing to entertain a motley and disorderly
audience seated in a still more disorderly
array before them.</p>
<p>At the right of the room a long bar stretched
from the street back as far as the stage, and standing
in front of this, boisterous groups of men were
smoking and drinking, or wrangling in tipsy fashion.
The opposite side of the big room was given
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
over to gambling devices of every sort, and this
space was filled with men sitting about small
tables and others sitting and standing along one
side of long tables, at each of which one man was
dealing cards, singly, out of a metal case held in
his hand. Other men clustered about revolving
wheels where, oblivious of everything going on
around them, they watched with feverish anxiety
a ball thrown periodically into the disc by the
man operating the wheel.</p>
<p>Bucks walked slowly down the room the full
length of the bar, scanning each group of men
as he passed. He crossed the room behind the
chairs where the audience of the singers and dancers
sat. He noticed, when he reached this, the
difference in the faces he was scrutinizing. At the
gambling tables the men saw and heard nothing of
what went on about them. He walked patiently
on his quest from group to group, unobserved by
those about him, but without catching a sight of
the elusive engineman. As he reached the end
of the gambling-room, he hesitated for a moment
and had finished his quest when, drawn by curiosity,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
he stopped for an instant to watch the scene
about the roulette wheels.</p>
<p>Almost instantly he heard a sharp voice behind
him. &#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucks, surprised, turned to find himself confronted
by the black-bearded passenger conductor,
David Hawk. Baxter&#8217;s admonition to say nothing
of what he was doing confused Bucks for an instant,
and he stammered some evasive answer.</p>
<p>Hawk, blunt and stern in word and manner,
followed the evasion up sharply: &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know
this is no place for you?&#8221; and before Bucks could
answer, Hawk had fixed him with his piercing eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to hang around a gambling-table, do
you? You want to watch how it is done and try
it yourself sometime? You want to see how much
smarter you can play the game than these sheep-heads
you are watching?</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk to me,&#8221; he exclaimed sternly as
Bucks tried to explain. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen boys in these
places before. I know where they end. If I
ever catch you in a gambling-den again I&#8217;ll throw
you neck and heels into the river.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></div>
<p>The words fell upon Bucks like a cloud-burst.
Before he could return a word or catch his breath
Hawk strode away.</p>
<p>As Bucks stood collecting his wits, Baggs, the
man for whom he was looking, passed directly
before his eyes. Bucks sprang forward, caught
Baggs by the arm, and led him toward the door,
as he gave him Baxter&#8217;s message. Baggs, listening
somewhat sheepishly, made no objection to
going down to take his train and walked through
the front door with Bucks out into the street.</p>
<p>As they did this, a red-faced man who was
standing on the doorstep seized Bucks&#8217;s sleeve
and attempted to jerk him across the sidewalk.
Bucks shook himself free and turned on his assailant.
He needed no introduction to the hard
cheeks, one of which was split by a deep scar.
It was Perry, Rebstock&#8217;s crony, whom Stanley had
driven out of Sellersville on the Spider Water.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing around here interfering
with my business?&#8221; he demanded of Bucks
harshly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve watched you spying around. The
next time I catch you trying to pull a customer
out of my place, I&#8217;ll knock your head off.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></div>
<p>Bucks eyed the bully with gathering wrath.
He was already upset mentally, and taken so
suddenly and unawares lost his temper and his
caution. &#8220;If you do, it will be the last head
you knock off in Medicine Bend,&#8221; he retorted.
&#8220;When I find trainmen in your joint that are
needed on their runs, I&#8217;ll pull them out every
time. The safest thing you can do is to keep
quiet. If the railroad men ever get started after
you, you red-faced bully, they&#8217;ll run you and your
whole tribe into the river again.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a foolish defiance and might have cost
him his life, though Bucks knew he was well within
the truth in what he said. Among the railroad
men the feeling against the gamblers was constantly
growing in bitterness. Perry instantly attempted
to draw a revolver, when a man who had
been watching the scene unobserved stepped close
enough between him and Bucks to catch Perry&#8217;s
eye. It was Dave Hawk again. What he had just
heard had explained things to him and he stood
now grimly laughing at the enraged gambler.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good for the boy,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Want to
get strung up, do you, Perry? Fire that gun just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
once and the vigilantes will have a rope around
your neck in five minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perry, though furious, realized the truth of
what Hawk said. He poured a torrent of abuse
upon Bucks, but made no further effort to use his
gun. The dreaded word &#8220;vigilantes&#8221; had struck
terror to the heart of a man who had once been
in their hands and escaped only by an accident.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know what he said is so, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
laughed Hawk savagely. &#8220;What? You don&#8217;t?&#8221;
he demanded, as Perry tried to face him down.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll be lucky, when that time comes, if you
don&#8217;t get your heels tangled up with a telegraph
pole before you reach the river,&#8221; concluded Hawk
tauntingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let him keep away from me if he doesn&#8217;t want
trouble,&#8221; snarled the discomfited gambler, eying
Bucks threateningly. But he was plainly out-faced,
and retreated, grumbling, toward the dance-hall
steps.</p>
<p>Dan Baggs, at the first sign of hostilities, had
fled. Bucks, afraid of losing him, now followed,
leaving Hawk still abusing the gambler, but when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
he overtook the engineman he found he was going,
as he had promised, straight to the roundhouse.</p>
<p>It was almost time for the night trick. Bucks
hastened upstairs to the despatchers&#8217; office and reported
to Baxter, who had returned ahead of him
and was elated at Bucks&#8217;s success. Before the
young substitute took up his train-sheet, he told
the chief despatcher of how strangely the conductor,
Dave Hawk, had talked to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has a reason for it,&#8221; responded Baxter
briefly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What reason?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is as good a railroad man as ever lived,&#8221;
said Baxter, referring to the black-bearded conductor.
&#8220;He is the master of us all in the handling
of trains. He could be anything anybody is
on this line to-day that he might want to be but
for one thing. If he hadn&#8217;t ruined his own life,
Dave Hawk could be superintendent here. He
knows whereof he speaks, Bucks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean he is a gambler. Did you hear the
shooting after I left you?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No, what was it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It must have been while you were in Perry&#8217;s.
Not five minutes after we parted, a saloon-keeper
shot a woman down right in front of me; I was
standing less than ten feet from her when she fell,&#8221;
said the despatcher, recounting the incident. &#8220;But
I was too late to protect her; and I should probably
have been shot myself if I had tried to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was the brute arrested?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Arrested! Who arrests anybody in this town?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How long is this sort of thing going on?&#8221; asked
Bucks, sitting down and signing a transfer.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long!&#8221; echoed the despatcher, taking up
his hat to go to his room. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how
long. But when their time comes&ndash;&ndash;God help that
crowd up Front Street!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>
<p>Following Collins&#8217;s return to duty, Bucks was
assigned to a new western station, Point of Rocks.
It was in the mountains and where Casement, now
laying five and even six miles of track a day, had
just turned over a hundred and eighty miles to
the operating department. Bucks, the first operator
ever sent to the lonely place afterward famous
in railroad story, put his trunk aboard a
freight train the next morning and started for his
destination.</p>
<p>The ride through the mountains was an inspiration.
A party of army officers and their wives,
preferring to take the day run for the scenery,
were bound for one of the mountain posts, Fort
Bridger, and they helped to make the long day
journey in the cabin car, with its frequent stops
and its laborious engine-puffing over the mountain
grades, a pleasant one. The women made
coffee on a cabin stove and Bucks, the only other
passenger, was invited to lunch with them.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></div>
<p>When the train stopped at Point of Rocks and
Bucks got off, the sun was setting, and though the
thin, clear air brought the distant mountains very
close, the prospect was not a cheerful one. In
every direction mountain ranges, some brown and
others snow-capped, rose upon the horizon. Where
the railroad line made a tortuous way among the
barren buttes that dotted the uneven plain all
about, there was not a spear of grass nor a living
thing except the stunted sage-brush of the alkali
plain. In the midst of this desert a great upheaval
of granite rock thrown squarely across the direct
path of the railroad opposed its straight course
and made a long reverse curve necessary. This
was Point of Rocks.</p>
<p>&#8220;You,&#8221; said Stanley once to Bucks, &#8220;may
live to see this railroad built across these mountains
as it should be built. There will be no
sharp curves then, no heavy grades such as
these our little engines have to climb now. Great
compound locomotives will pull trains of a hundred
cars up grades of less than one per cent and
around two and three degree curves. These high
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
wooden bridges will all be replaced by big rock
and earth fills. Tunnels will pierce the heights
that cannot be scaled by easy grades, and electric
power supplied by these mountain streams themselves
will take the place of steam made by coal
and hauled hundreds of miles to give us costly
motive power. You may live, Bucks, to see all of
this; I shall not. When it comes, think of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>But there was no thought now in Bucks&#8217;s mind
of what the future might bring to that forbidding
desert. He saw only a rude station building, just
put up, and as the train disappeared, he dragged
into this his trunk and hand-bag, and in that act
a new outpost of civilization was established in the
great West.</p>
<p>He called up Medicine Bend, reported, lighted
a fire in the little stove, and the spot in the desert
known now to men as Point of Rocks for the first
time in the story of the world became a part of
it&ndash;&ndash;was linked to the world itself.</p>
<p>But the place was lonely beyond words, and
Bucks had a hard time to keep it from being too
much so for him. He walked at different times over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
the country in every direction, and one night after
a crudely prepared supper he strolled out on the
platform, desperate for something to do. Desolation
marked the landscape everywhere. He
wandered aimlessly across the track and seeing
nothing better to interest him began climbing
Point of Rocks.</p>
<p>The higher he climbed the more absorbed he
became. Youth and strength lent ardor to the
ascent, and Bucks, soon forgetting everything
below, was scaling the granite pile that towered
above him. For thirty minutes, without a halt, he
continued to climb, and reaching after a while
what seemed the highest ledge of the rocky spur,
he walked out upon it to the very edge and was
rewarded for his labor with a magnificent panorama
of the mountain divide.</p>
<p>In the west the sky was still golden and, though
clouds appeared to be banking heavily in the
north, the view of the distant peaks was unobstructed.
From where he sat he could almost
have thrown a stone into one tiny mountain
stream that cut a silver path toward the setting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
sun, and another, a hundred yards away, that
flowed gently toward the rising sun. And he
knew&ndash;&ndash;for Bill Dancing had told him&ndash;&ndash;that the
one rill emptied at last into the Pacific Ocean,
and the other into the Atlantic Ocean. Alongside
these tiny streams he could plainly trace the overland
trail of the emigrant wagons, and, cutting in
straighter lines, but following the same general direction,
lay the right-of-way of the new transcontinental
railroad.</p>
<p>Beyond, in every direction, stretched great plateaus,
and above these rugged mountain chains,
lying in what seemed the eternal solitude of the
vast desert. He was alone with the sunset, and
stood for some moments silenced by the scene
before him. When a sound did at length reach
his ear as he sat spellbound, it brought him back
to himself with the suddenness of a shock.</p>
<p>At first he heard only distant echoes of a short,
muffled blow, irregularly repeated and seeming
familiar to the ear. As he speculated upon what
the sound might be, it grew gradually plainer and
came seemingly nearer. He bent his eyes down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
the valley to the west and scanned the wagon-trail
and the railroad track as far as he could in
the dusk, but could see nothing. Then the muffle
of the sound was at once lifted. It came from
the other direction, and, turning his eyes, he saw
emerging from a small canyon that hid the trail
to the east, a covered emigrant wagon, drawn by
a large team of horses and driven by a man sitting
in front of the hood, making its way slowly
up the road toward the station.</p>
<p>The heavy play of the wheel-hubs on the axles
echoed now very plainly upon his ears, and he sat
watching the outfit and wondering whether the
travellers would camp for the night near him and
give him what he craved most of all, a little human
society. The horses passed the station, and as
they did so, the driver peered intently at the new
building, looking back around the side of the
canvas cover, and straining his neck to see all he
could see, while the horses moved along.</p>
<p>This would have seemed to Bucks mere idle
curiosity had he not noticed that some one within
the wagon parted the canvas flaps at the rear as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
it went by and likewise inspected the building
with close attention. Even this was no especial
incident for wonderment, nor was Bucks surprised
when the emigrants, after pursuing their way until
they were well out of sight of the station itself,
guided their wagon from the trail into a little depression
along the creek as if to make camp for
the night. The driver, a tall, thin man, wearing
a slouch hat, got down from the front of the
wagon and walked with a shambling gait to the
head of his horses and loosened their bridles.
While the horses were drinking, a second man,
carrying a rifle, climbed down from the rear of
the wagon. He was of a shorter and stockier
build, and on one side the brim of his soft hat
had been torn away so that it hung loosely over
one ear, the other ear being covered only by a
shock of dusty hair.</p>
<p>A third man emerged from under the canvas
cover, dropping down almost behind the second&ndash;&ndash;a
fat man who looked about him with suspicion
as he slowly drew a rifle out of the wagon. The
driver joined his companions for a brief conference,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
and when it was finished the three men, examining
their rifles, walked back up the road toward the
station. As they neared it, two of them loitered
back and presently took their places behind convenient
rocks where, without being seen, they
could see everything. The third man, the driver,
carrying his rifle on his arm, walked ahead, crossed
the road, and, proceeding with some care, stepped
up on the platform and pushed open the door of
the station building.</p>
<p>Bucks, perched high on the rocky spur above
the scene, looked on, not knowing just what to
make of it all. As he saw the two men conceal
themselves, he wondered what sort of a call the
third man intended making on the new agent, and
why he should leave two armed men close at hand
in ambush when calling on one lone telegraph
operator. Bucks began to feel a bit creepy and
watched the scene unfolding below with keen attention.
The driver of the wagon getting no response
as he opened the door, walked inside, and
for a moment was not seen. He soon reappeared,
and, stepping to the side of the building signalled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
his companions to come up. Bucks saw them
emerge from their hiding-places and join the driver
at the station door.</p>
<p>A second conference followed. It was briefer
than the first, but there seemed some difference
of opinion among the three men, and the talk
terminated abruptly by the driver&#8217;s clubbing his
rifle and deliberately smashing in the sash of the
window before which he was standing.</p>
<p>Whatever had held Bucks spellbound thus far
released him suddenly for action when he saw the
rifle-stock raised and heard the crash of the glass.
He jumped up, and running to the edge of the
ledge nearest the station yelled at the marauder
and shook his finger at him vigorously. The attack
on his habitation was too much for Bucks&#8217;s
composure, and, although he knew his words could
not be heard from where he stood, he felt he
could frighten the intruders.</p>
<p>This was his second mistake. No sooner had
his visitors sighted him than two guns were turned
on him and instantly fired. He jumped back before
the fat man, who, slower than his companions,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
had some difficulty in shooting so high above
his head, could get his gun up. Afterward,
Bucks learned how providential this was, inasmuch
as the big fellow was the deadliest shot of
the three.</p>
<p>But at the moment, danger was the last thing
the operator thought of. The unprovoked and
murderous attack infuriated him, and again forgetting
his caution he drew his own revolver without
hesitation, and, running to a more protected
spot, leaned over the ledge and fired point-blank
into the group, as they looked up to see what had
become of him.</p>
<p>If it had been his intention to hit any one of them
with his bullets, his shooting was a failure and
some experience in after years among men practised
in gunnery convinced him that to aim at
three men is not the right way to hit one.</p>
<p>But if he had meant only to create a sensation
his move was successful beyond his greatest expectation.
Had a bomb been exploded on the
platform the marauders could not have scattered
more quickly. Bucks never in his life had seen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
three men move so fast. The fat man, indeed,
had given Bucks the impression of being heavy
and slow in his movements. He now made a
surprising exhibition of agility, and Bucks to
his astonishment, saw him distancing his leaner
companions and sprinting for the shelter at a
pace that would have made a jack-rabbit take
notice.</p>
<p>Bucks, somewhat keyed up, fired twice again
at the fleeing men, but with no more effect than
to kick up the dust once behind and once ahead
of them as they ran. The instant they reached
the rocks where they found shelter Bucks drew
back out of sight, and none too soon, for as he
pulled himself away from the ledge, a rifle cracked
viciously from below and the slug threw a chunk
of granite almost up into his face; the fat man
was evidently having his innings.</p>
<p>Bucks, out of immediate danger, lay perfectly
still for a few moments casting up the strange
situation he found himself in. Why the men
should have acted as they had, was all a mystery,
but thieves or outlaws they evidently were, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
outlaws in this country he already well knew were
men who would stop at nothing.</p>
<p>He realized, likewise, that he was in grave danger.
The night was before him. No train would
be through before morning. He could not reach
his key by which he might have summoned aid
instantly. For a moment he lay thinking. Then
taking off his hat he stuck his head carefully forward;
it was greeted at once by a bullet. The
lesson was obvious and next time he wanted to
reconnoitre he stuck his hat forward first on the
muzzle of his gun, as he had often read of frontiersmen
doing, and, having drawn a shot, stuck
his head out afterward for a quick look. All that
remained in the open was the team and wagon,
but this left the outlaws at a disadvantage, for
if they wanted to get their outfit and go on their
way they must expose themselves to Bucks&#8217;s fire.
While they might feel that one operator, armed
with a revolver he hardly knew how to use, was
not a dangerous foe, a Colt&#8217;s, even in the hands of
a boy who had thus far fired first and aimed afterward,
was not wholly to be despised. An accident
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
might happen even under such conditions,
and the three men, knowing that darkness would
soon leave them free, waited in absolute silence.</p>
<p>Night fell very soon and the light of the stars,
though leaving objects visible upon the high ledge,
left the earth in impenetrable darkness. Strain
his eyes as he would, Bucks could perceive nothing
below. He could hear, however, and one of
the first sounds audible was that of the wagon
moving quietly away. It was a welcome sound,
even though he dared not hope his troublesome
visitors would withdraw without further mischief.
His chief concern at this juncture was to get safely,
if he could, down the rocks and into the station
to give the alarm to the despatcher; for he made
no doubt that the outlaws, on their wagon trip
west, would damage in any way they might be able
railroad supplies and property along their way.</p>
<p>Before Bucks had climbed down very far and
after he had made one or two startling missteps,
he began to consider that it was one thing to get
up a rough ar&ecirc;te in daylight and quite another
to get down one in the darkness. The heavy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
clouds moving down from the north had massed
above Point of Rocks, and he heard once in a
while an ominous roll of thunder, as he slipped
and slid along and bruised his hands and feet
upon the rocks.</p>
<p>He had with great care got about half-way
down, when the pitch darkness below him was
pierced by a small flame which he took at first
for the blaze of a camp fire. In another moment
he was undeceived. The station was on fire. It
was evidently the last effort of the outlaws to
wreak vengeance as they left. Bucks clambered
over the rocks in great alarm. He thought he
might reach the building in time to save it, and,
forgetting the danger of being shot should his
enemies remain lying in wait, he made his way
rapidly down the Point. The flames now burst
from the east window of the station, and he despaired
of saving it, but he hurried on until he
heard the crack of a rifle, felt his cap snatched
from his head and fell backward against the face
of the rock. As he lost consciousness he slipped
and rolled headlong down the steep ledge.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XVII' id='CHAPTER_XVII'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>
<p>How long Bucks lay in the darkness he did not
know, but he woke to consciousness with thunder
crashing in his ears and a flood of rain beating
on his upturned face. When he opened his eyes
he was blinded by sheets of lightning trembling
across the sky, and he turned his face from the
pelting rain until he could collect himself.</p>
<p>While he lay insensible from the shock of the
bullet, which providentially had only grazed his
scalp, the storm had burst over the mountains
drowning everything before it. Water fell in torrents,
and the desert below him was one wide
river. Water danced and swam down the rocks
and ran in broad, shallow waves over the sand,
and the scene was light as day. Thunder peals
crashed one upon another like salvoes of artillery,
deafening and alarming the confused boy, and the
rain poured without ceasing. Continuing waves
of lightning revealed the railroad and station
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
building before him and he realized that he had
fallen the rest of the way down from where he
had been fired at on the face of the Point.</p>
<p>He took quick stock of his condition and, rising
to his feet, found himself only sore and bruised.
He pressed his way through the flood to the track,
gained the platform, and, judging rightly that his
assailants had abandoned their fight, entered the
half-burned building unafraid. Rain poured in
one corner where the roof had burned away before
the storm had put out the fire.</p>
<p>Stumbling through the d&eacute;bris that covered the
floor, Bucks made his way to the operator&#8217;s table
and put his hand up to cut in the lightning arrester.
He was too late. The fire had taken
everything ahead of him, and his hope of getting
into communication with the despatchers was next
dashed by the discovery that his instruments
were wrecked.</p>
<p>He sat down&ndash;&ndash;his chair was intact&ndash;&ndash;much disheartened.
But without delay he opened the
drawer of the table and feeling for his box of
cartridges found that the thieves had overlooked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
it. This he slipped into his pocket with a feeling
of relief, and, as he sat, rain-soaked and with the
water dripping from his hair, he reloaded his revolver
and made such preparations as he could to
barricade the inner door and wait for the passing
of the storm.</p>
<p>From time to time, awed by the fury of the
elements, he looked into the night. It seemed as
if the valley as far as he could see was a vast
lake that rippled and danced over the rocks.
Bucks had never conceived of a thunderstorm like
this. Until it abated there was nothing he could
do, and he sat in wretched discomfort, hour after
hour, waiting for the night to pass and listening
to the mighty roar of the waters as they swept
broadside down the divide carrying everything
ahead of them. Before daylight the violence of
the storm wore itself away, but the creek in the
little canyon south of the right-of-way, dashing its
swollen bulk against the granite walls, pounded and
roared with the fury of a cataract.</p>
<p>When day broke, ragged masses of gray cloud
scudded low across the sky. The rain had ceased,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
and in the operator&#8217;s room Bucks, aided by the
first rays of daylight, was struggling to get the
telegraph wires disentangled to send a message.
His hopes, as the light increased and he saw the
ruin caused by the fire, were very slender, but he
kept busily at the wreckage and getting, at
length, two severed strands of the wires to show
a current, began sending his call, followed by a
message for help to Medicine Bend. He worked
at this for thirty minutes unceasingly, then, looking
around on every side of the building, he satisfied
himself that he was alone and, dropping
down at his table, leaned upon it with his elbows,
and, tired, wet, and begrimed, fell fast asleep.</p>
<p>He was roused by the distant whistle of a locomotive.
Opening his eyes, he saw the sun
streaming through the east side of the building
where the window casement had burned away.
Shaking off the heaviness of his slumber he hastened
out to see an engine and box-car coming
from the east. From the open door of the car
men were waving their hats. Bucks answered by
swinging his arm.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></div>
<p>The engine stopped before the station and Bob
Scott, followed by Dancing, Dave Hawk, and the
train crew sprang from the caboose steps and surrounded
him. They had brought two horses and
Bucks saw that all the men were armed. It took
only a minute to tell the story, and the party
scattered to view the destruction and look for
clues to the perpetrators.</p>
<p>Scott and Dancing were especially keen in their
search, but they found nothing to suggest who
the vandals were. They listened again to Bucks,
as he repeated his story with more detail, and held
a hurried conference in which Dave Hawk took
charge. Meantime the men were tearing up planks
from the platform to make a chute for unloading
the horses.</p>
<p>Bucks&#8217;s excitement increased as he saw the businesslike
preparations for the chase. &#8220;Have you
any idea you can catch them, Bob?&#8221; he asked
feverishly.</p>
<p>Bob Scott&#8217;s smile was not a complete answer.
&#8220;How can you catch anybody in <i>this</i> country?&#8221;
continued Bucks, regarding the scout sceptically.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
But Scott looked across the interminable waste of
sage-brush and rock as if he felt at home with it.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they stick to the wagon,&#8221; he explained
leisurely, &#8220;we will have them in an hour or two,
Bucks. A man might as well travel around here
with a brass band as to try to get away with a
wagon track behind him. If they stick to the
wagon, we are bound to have them in two or three
hours at most. You are sure they didn&#8217;t have a
led horse?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They had nothing but the team,&#8221; said Bucks.</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case if they give up the wagon, three
of them will have to ride two horses. They can&#8217;t
go fast in that way. We will get some of them,
Bucks, sure&ndash;&ndash;somehow, sometime, somewhere.
We have got to get them. How could I hold my
job if I didn&#8217;t get them?&#8221;</p>
<p>That which had seemed impossible to Bucks
looked more hopeful after Bob had smiled again.
Dancing was busy installing the new telegraph
outfit. While this was going on, Scott saddled the
horses and, when he and Dave Hawk had mounted,
the two rode rapidly down the emigrant trail
toward Bitter Creek. The train was held until
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
Dancing could get the instruments working again;
then, at Hawk&#8217;s request, it was sent down the
Bitter Creek grade after himself and Scott; the
trail followed the railroad for miles. Dancing remained
with Bucks to guard against further attack.</p>
<p>The two railroad men rode carefully along the
heavy ruts of the emigrant trail, from which all
recent tracks had been obliterated by the flood,
knowing that they would strike no sign of the
wagon until it had been started after the storm.
They had covered in this manner less than two
miles when, rounding a little bend, they saw a
covered emigrant wagon standing in the road not
half a mile from the railroad track.</p>
<p>Scott led quickly toward concealment and from
behind a shoulder of rock to which the two rode
they could see that the wagon had been halted
and the horses, strangely entangled in the harness,
were lying in front of it. Scott and Hawk
dismounted and, crawling up the shoulder where
they could see without being seen, waited impatiently
for some sign of life from the suspicious
outfit. The description Bucks had given fitted
the wagon very well, and the two lay for a time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
waiting for something to happen, and exchanging
speculations as to what the situation might
mean. They were hoping that the thieves might,
if they had gone away, return, and with this
thought restrained their impatience.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be a trick to get us up to shooting
distance, Bob,&#8221; suggested Hawk when Scott proposed
they should close in.</p>
<p>&#8220;But that wouldn&#8217;t explain why the horses are
lying there in that way, Dave. Something else has
happened. Those horses are dead; they haven&#8217;t
moved. Suppose I circle the outfit,&#8221; suggested
Scott benevolently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take care they don&#8217;t get a shot at you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If they can get a shot at me before I can at
them they are welcome,&#8221; returned Scott as he
picked up his bridle rein. &#8220;From what Bucks
told me I don&#8217;t think a great deal of their shooting.
He is a level-headed boy, that long-legged
operator.&#8221; And Scott, with some quiet grimaces,
recounted Bucks&#8217;s story of his descent of Point of
Rocks the night before, under the fire of the three
desperadoes.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></div>
<p>That he himself was now taking his own life
in his hands as he started on a perilous reconnoissance,
cost him no thought. Such a situation he
was quite used to. But for a green boy from the
East to put up so unequal a fight seemed to the
experienced scout a most humorous proceeding.</p>
<p>He mounted his horse and directing Hawk what
to do if he should be hit, set out to ride completely
around the suspected wagon. The canvas cover
was the uncertain element in the situation. It
might conceal nobody, and yet it might conceal
three rifles waiting for an indiscreet pursuer to
come within range. Scott, taking advantage of
the uneven country, rode circumspectly to the
south, keeping the object of his caution well in
view, and at times, under cover of friendly rocks,
getting up quite close to it.</p>
<p>Before he had completed half his ride he had
satisfied himself as to the actual state of affairs.
Yet his habitual caution led him to follow out his
original purpose quite as carefully as if he had
reached no conclusion. When he crossed the trail
west of the wagon, he looked closely for fresh
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
tracks, but there were none. He then circled to
the north and was soon able, by dismounting, to
crawl under cover within a hundred yards of the
heads of the horses. When he got up to where
he could see without being seen he perceived
clearly that his surmise had been correct.</p>
<p>Both horses lay dead in the harness. From the
front seat of the wagon a boot protruded; nothing
more could be seen. Scott now, by signals,
summoned Dave Hawk from where he lay, and
when the swarthy conductor reached the scout,
Scott called out loudly at the wagon.</p>
<p>There was no answer, no movement, no sound.
Things began to seem queer; in the bright blaze
of sunshine, and with the parched desert glistening
after the welcome rain, there in the midst of
the vast amphitheatre of mountains lay the dead
horses before the mysterious wagon. But nowhere
about was any sign of life, and the wagon
might hold within its white walls death for whoever
should unwarily approach it.</p>
<p>Bob Scott had no idea, however, of sacrificing
himself to any scheme that might have occurred
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
to the enemy to lure him within danger. He
called out again at the top of his voice and demanded
a surrender. No sound gave any response,
and raising his rifle he sent a bullet through the
extreme top of the canvas cover midway back
from the driver&#8217;s seat.</p>
<p>The echoes of the report crashed back to the
rocks, but brought nothing from the silence of the
emigrant wagon. A second shot followed, tearing
through the side board of the wagon-box itself;
yet there was no answer. Scott, taking his horse,
while Hawk remained in hiding and covered the
scene with his own rifle, led the horse so that it
served as a shelter and walked directly toward the
wagon itself. As he neared it he approached from
the front, pausing at times to survey what he saw.
Hawk watched him lead his unwilling horse,
trembling with fear, up to the dead team as they
lay in the bright sunlight, and saw Scott take
hold of the protruding boot, peer above it into
the wagon itself and, without turning his head,
beckon Hawk to come up.</p>
<p>Under the canvas, the driver of the wagon lay
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
dead with the lines clutched in his stiffened fingers,
just as he had fallen when death struck his horses.
The two frontiersmen needed no explanation of
what they saw in the scarred and blackened face
of the outlaw. A bolt of lightning had killed him
and stricken both horses in the same instant.
Bob crawled into the wagon and with Hawk&#8217;s
help dragged the dead man forward into the sunlight.
Both recognized him. It was Bucks&#8217;s assailant
and enemy, the Medicine Bend and Spider
Water gambler, Perry.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>
<p>The two men, aided by the crew of the train
that now came down the Bitter Creek grade, got
the dead body of the outlaw back to Point of
Rocks just as a mixed train from the east reached
there, with Stanley and a detail of cavalry aboard.
Stanley walked straight to Bucks, caught him by
the shoulders, and shook him as if to make sure
he was all right.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gave you a warm reception, did they, Bucks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Moderately warm, colonel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stanley shook his head. &#8220;It is all wrong.
They never should have sent you out here alone,&#8221;
he declared brusquely. &#8220;These superintendents
seem to think they are railroading in Ohio instead
of the Rocky Mountains. Dave,&#8221; he continued,
turning to Hawk as the latter came up, &#8220;I hear
you have just brought in Perry dead. What have
we got here, anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the Medicine Bend gang,&#8221; returned
Hawk tersely.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What are they doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Evening up old scores, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stanley looked at the dead man as they laid
him out on the platform: &#8220;And hastening their
own day of reckoning,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There shall
be no more of this if we have to drive every man
of the gang out of the country. Who do you
think was with Perry, Bob?&#8221; he demanded, questioning
Scott.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing to show that till we get
them&ndash;&ndash;and we ought to be after them now,&#8221; returned
the scout. &#8220;But,&#8221; he added softly as he
hitched his trousers, &#8220;I think one of the two
might be young John Rebstock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You need lose no time, Bob. Here are ten
men with fresh horses at your orders.&#8221; Stanley
pointed to the troopers who were unloading their
mounts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give Dave and me three of the best of these
men,&#8221; said Scott. &#8220;I will follow the west trail.
Put a sergeant with the others on the trail east
to make sure they haven&#8217;t doubled back on us&ndash;&ndash;but
I don&#8217;t think they have.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They must have stolen that team and wagon,
that is certain. More than likely they murdered
the man they took it from. The trail is probably
alive with men looking for them. These fellows
were trying to get to Casement&#8217;s camp for gambling,
and probably they are heading that way
fast now. We will pick those fellows up, colonel,
somewhere between here and Bridger&#8217;s Gap.&#8221;</p>
<p>The three troopers that Scott selected were
told off and, after a few rapid arrangements for
sending back information, the five men of the
west-trail party, headed by Scott and Dave Hawk,
rode down Bitter Creek and, scattering in a wide
skirmish line wherever the formation of the country
permitted, scanned the ground for signs of
the fugitives.</p>
<p>&#8220;We shan&#8217;t find anything till we get to where
they were when the rain stopped,&#8221; Scott told the
trooper near whom he was riding. It was, in fact,
nearly ten miles from Point of Rocks before they
picked up the footprints of two men travelling
apart from each other, but headed north and west.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
These they followed on a long d&eacute;tour away from
the regular wagon road until the two trails turned
and entered, from the southwest, a camp made the
night before by a big trading outfit on the regular
overland trail.</p>
<p>Here, of course, all trace of the men disappeared.
It was now drawing toward evening.
Scott resolved to follow the trading outfit, but
the party still rode slowly to make sure the men
they wanted did not sneak away from the wagons
of their new-found friends. The pursuers rode
steadily on, and as the sun went down they perceived
in a small canyon ahead of them the
wagons of the outfit they were trailing, parked in
a camp for the night.</p>
<p>Scott gave the troopers directions as to where
to post themselves, at some distance east and west
of the canyon, to provide against a sortie of the
fugitives and, riding with Hawk directly into the
camp, asked for the boss. He appeared after
some delay and proved to be a French trader with
supplies for Salt Lake.</p>
<p>Hawk, whose long visage and keen eyes gave
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
him a particularly stern air&ndash;&ndash;and David Hawk
was never very communicative or very warm-mannered&ndash;&ndash;asked
the questions. The Frenchman
was civil, but denied having any men with him
except those he had brought from the Missouri
River. However, he offered to line up his men
for the railroad party to look over. To this Hawk
agreed, and, when the word had been passed, the
entire force of the trader were assembled in front
of the head wagon.</p>
<p>Scott rode slowly up the line scrutinizing each
face, and, turning again, rode down the line. Once
he stopped and questioned a suspicious-looking
teamster wearing a hat that answered Bucks&#8217;s
description, but the man&#8217;s answers were satisfactory.</p>
<p>When Scott had finished his inspection the
men started to disband. Hawk stopped them.
&#8220;Stay where you are,&#8221; he called out curtly.
Turning to the Frenchman, he added: &#8220;We will
have to search your wagons.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the trader made no objection, though
some of his men did.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></div>
<p>The three troopers were signalled in, and posted
so there could be no dodging from one wagon to
another, and Hawk gave them orders, loud enough
for all to hear, to shoot on sight any one leaving
the wagons. And while he himself kept command
of the whole situation, Scott dismounted and accompanied
by the trader began the search. The
hunt was tedious and the teamsters murmured
at the delay to their camp work. But the search
went forward unrelentingly. Not a corner capable
of concealing a dog was overlooked by the painstaking
Indian and not until he had reached the
last wagon was his hope exhausted.</p>
<p>This wagon stood at the extreme end of a wash-out
in the side of the canyon itself. It was filled
with bales of coarse red blankets, but no man was
to be found among them.</p>
<p>Scott did find something, however, in a sort of
a nest fashioned among the bales near the middle
of the wagon. What would have escaped an eye
less trained to look for trifles attracted his at
once. It was a dingy metal tag. Scott picked
it up. It bore the name of a Medicine Bend
saloon and the heads of three horses, from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
design of which the saloon itself took a widely
known and ill name. He laid his hand on the
blanket from which he had picked the tag. The
wool was still warm.</p>
<p>Scott only smiled to himself. Both ends of the
little canyon were guarded. From where he was
searching the scout peered carefully out at the
canyon walls. There were hiding-places, but they
were hardly large enough to conceal a man. It
was somewhere in the rocks close at hand that
the fugitives had found a temporary refuge; but
they could not now escape&ndash;&ndash;nor could they be
far from the wagon.</p>
<p>Without losing sight of the surroundings, Scott,
disclosing nothing of his discovery to the trader,
announced that he was satisfied and that the men
he wanted did not appear to be there. He added,
however, that if the Frenchman had no objection
his party would pitch camp close by and ride with
him in the morning. The Frenchman maintained
his courtesy by inviting the party to take supper
with him, and Scott, agreeing to return, rode away
with Hawk and the three troopers.</p>
<p>They had not ridden far, when Bob dismounted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
the party and leaving the horses with one trooper
set two as pickets and posted himself in hiding
on one side the canyon, with Hawk on the other, to
watch the camp. What he saw or whether his
patience was in any degree rewarded no one could
have told from his inscrutable face as he walked
into the camp at dusk and sat down with the
trader to supper. The moon was just rising and
down at the creek, a little way from where Scott
sat, some belated teamsters were washing their
hands and faces and preparing their own supper.
Scott ate slowly and with his back to the fire
kept his eye on the group of men down at the
creek. When he had finished, he walked down
to the stream himself. A large man in the group
fitted, in his hat and dress, Bucks&#8217;s exact description.
Scott had already spotted him an hour
before, and stepped up to him now to arrest young
John Rebstock.</p>
<p>He laid his hand on the man&#8217;s shoulder and
the man turned. But to Scott&#8217;s surprise he was
not the man wanted at all. He wore Rebstock&#8217;s
clothes and fitted Rebstock&#8217;s description, but he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
was not Rebstock. The scout understood instantly
how he had been tricked, but gave no
sign.</p>
<p>Within the preceding thirty minutes the real
Rebstock, whom Scott had already marked from
his hiding-place in the canyon, had traded clothes
with this man and, no doubt, made good his
escape.</p>
<p>If Bob was chagrined, he made no sign.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must have made a good trade,&#8221; he said,
smiling at the teamster. &#8220;These clothes are a
little big, but you will grow to them. How much
boot did you get?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott looked so slight and inoffensive that the
teamster attempted insolence, and not only refused
to answer questions, but threatened violence
if the scout persisted in asking them. His companions
crowding up encouraged him.</p>
<p>But numbers were not allowed for an instant
to dominate the situation. Scott whipped a revolver
from his belt, cocked it, and pressed it against
the teamster&#8217;s side. Dave Hawk loomed up in
the moonlight and, catching by the collar one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
after another of the men crowding around Scott,
Hawk, with his right hand or his left, whirled
them spinning out of his way. If a man resisted
the rough treatment, Hawk unceremoniously
knocked him down and, drawing his own revolver,
took his stand beside his threatened companion.</p>
<p>Other men came running up, the trader among
them. A few words explained everything and
the recalcitrant teamster concluded to speak.
Scott, indeed, had but little to ask: he already
knew the whole story. And when the teamster,
threatened with search, pulled from his pocket
a roll of bank-notes which he acknowledged had
been given him for concealing the two fugitives
and providing them with clothes, Scott released
him&ndash;&ndash;only notifying the trader incidentally that
the man was robbing him and had loot, taken
from the ammunition wagon, concealed under his
blanket bales just searched. This information led
to new excitement in the camp, and the Frenchman
danced up and down in his wrath as he ordered
the blanket wagon searched again. But his excitement
did not greatly interest Scott and his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
party. They went their way and camped at some
distance down the creek from their stirred-up
neighbors.</p>
<p>Hawk and Bob Scott sat in the moonlight after
the troopers had gone to sleep.</p>
<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t fool us very much longer,&#8221; muttered
Scott, satisfied with the day&#8217;s work and
taking the final disappointment philosophically,
&#8220;until they can get horses they are chained to
the ground in this country. There is only one
place I know of where there are any horses hereabouts
and that is Jack Casement&#8217;s camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hawk stretched himself out on the ground to
sleep. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you, Dave,&#8221; continued Scott,
&#8220;it is only about twenty miles from here to Casement&#8217;s,
anyway. Suppose I ride over there to-night
and wire Stanley we&#8217;ve got track of the
fellows. By the time you pick up the trail in
the morning I will be back&ndash;&ndash;or I may pick it up
myself between here and the railroad. You keep
on as far as Brushwood Creek and I&#8217;ll join you
there to-morrow by sundown.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was so arranged. The night was clear and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
with a good moon the ride was not difficult, though
to a man less acquainted with the mountains it
would have been a hardship. Mile after mile
Scott&#8217;s hardy pony covered with no apparent effort.
Bob did not urge him, and before midnight
the white tents of the construction camp were
visible in the moonlight. Scott went directly to
the telegraph office, and after sending his message
hunted up food and quarters for his beast and a
sleeping-bunk for himself.</p>
<p>At daylight he was astir and sought breakfast
before making inquiries and riding back to his
party. On the edge of the camp stood a sort of
restaurant, made up of a kitchen tent with a dismantled
box-car body as an annex.</p>
<p>In this annex the food was served. It was entered
from one side door, while the food was
brought from the kitchen through the other side
doorway of the car.</p>
<p>Into this crowded den Bob elbowed an unobtrusive
way and seated himself in a retired corner.
He faced the blind end of the car, and before him
on the wall was tacked a fragment of a mirror in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
which he could see what was going on behind
him. And without paying any apparent attention
to anything that went on, nothing escaped
him.</p>
<p>Next to where he sat, a breakfast of coffee and
ham and eggs had been already served for somebody,
apparently on an order previously given.
At the opposite end of the car a small space was
curtained off as a wash-room. Scott ordered his
own breakfast and was slowly eating it when he
noticed through the little mirror, and above and
beyond the heads of the busy breakfasters along
the serving-counter, a large man in the wash-room
scrubbing his face vigorously with a towel.</p>
<p>Each time Scott looked up from his breakfast
into the mirror the man redoubled his efforts to
do a good job with the towel, hiding his face
meantime well within its folds. The scout&#8217;s curiosity
was mildly enough aroused to impel him to
watch the diligent rubbing with some interest.
He saw, too, presently that the man was stealing
glances out of his towel at him and yet between
times intently rubbing his face.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></div>
<p>This seemed odd, and Scott, now eying the man
more carefully, noted his nervousness and wondered
at it. However, he continued to enjoy his
own meal. The waiter who had served him, hurried
and impatient, also noticed the waiting breakfast
untouched and called sharply to the man in
the wash-room that his ham was served and, with
scant regard for fine words, bade him come eat it.</p>
<p>This urgent invitation only added to the ill-concealed
embarrassment of the stalling guest;
but it interested the scout even more in the developing
situation. Scott finished his breakfast
and gave himself entirely over to watching in a
lazy way the man who was making so elaborate
a toilet.</p>
<p>There was no escape from either end of the
car. That could be managed only through the
side doors, which were too close to Scott to be
available, and the scout, now fairly well enlightened
and prepared, merely awaited developments.
He wanted to see the man come to his breakfast,
and the man in the wash-room, combing his hair
with vigor and peering anxiously through his own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
scrap of a mirror at Bob Scott, wanted to see the
scout finish his coffee and leave the car. Scott,
however, pounding ostentatiously on the table,
called for a second cup of coffee and sipped it
with apparent satisfaction. It was a game of cat
and mouse&ndash;&ndash;with the mouse, in this instance,
bigger than the cat, but as shy and reluctant to
move as any mouse could be in a cat&#8217;s presence.
Scott waited until he thought the embarrassed
man would have brushed the hair all out of his
head, and at last, in spite of himself, laughed.
As he did so, he turned half-way around on his
stool and lifted his finger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Rebstock,&#8221; he smiled, calling to the
fugitive. &#8220;Your breakfast is getting cold.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man, turning as red as a beet, looked over
the heads of those that sat between him and his
tantalizing captor. But putting the best face
he could on the dilemma and eying Scott nervously
he walked over and, with evident reluctance,
made ready to sit down beside him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take your time,&#8221; suggested Scott pleasantly.
Then, as Rebstock, quite crestfallen, seated himself,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
he added: &#8220;Hadn&#8217;t I better order a hot cup
of coffee for you?&#8221; He took hold of the cup as
he spoke, and looked hard at the gambler while
making the suggestion.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; responded Rebstock, equally polite
and equally insistent, as he held his hand over
the cup and begged Scott not to mind. &#8220;This
is all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How was the walking last night?&#8221; asked Scott,
passing the fugitive a big plate of bread. Rebstock
lifted his eyes from his plate for the briefest
kind of a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;The&ndash;&ndash;eh&ndash;&ndash;walking? I don&#8217;t know what you
mean, captain. I slept here last night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott looked under the table at his victim&#8217;s
boots. &#8220;John,&#8221; he asked without a smile, &#8220;do
you ever walk in your sleep?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rebstock threw down his knife and fork.
&#8220;Look here, stranger,&#8221; he demanded with indignation.
&#8220;What do you want? Can&#8217;t a man eat
his breakfast in this place? I ask you,&#8221; he demanded,
raising his right hand with his knife in
it as he appealed to the waiter, &#8220;can&#8217;t a man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
eat his breakfast in this place without interruption?&#8221;</p>
<p>The waiter, standing with folded arms, regarded
the two men without changing his stolid expression.
&#8220;A man can eat his breakfast in this place
without anything on earth except money. If you
let your ham get cold because you were going to
beat me out of the price, and you try to do it,
I&#8217;ll drag you out of here by the heels.&#8221;</p>
<p>These unsympathetic words attracted the attention
of every one and the breakfasters now
looked on curiously but no one offered to interfere.
Quarrels and disputes were too frequent in
that country to make it prudent or desirable ever
to intervene in one. A man considered himself
lucky not to be embroiled in unpleasantness in
spite of his best efforts to keep out. Rebstock
turned again on his pursuer. &#8220;What do you want,
anyhow, stranger?&#8221; he demanded fiercely. &#8220;A
fight, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it. I want you, Rebstock,&#8221; explained
Scott without in the least raising his
voice.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></div>
<p>Rebstock&#8217;s throaty tones seemed to contract
into a wheeze. &#8220;What do you want me for?&#8221;
he asked, looking nervously toward the other end
of the car. As he did so, a man wearing a shirt
and new overalls rose and started for the door.
The instinct of Scott&#8217;s suspicion fastened itself
on the man trying to leave the place as being Rebstock&#8217;s
wanted companion.</p>
<p>Rising like a flash, he covered the second man
with his pistol. &#8220;Hold on!&#8221; he exclaimed, pointing
at him with his left hand. &#8220;Come over here!&#8221;</p>
<p>The man in overalls turned a calm face that
showed nothing more than conscious innocence.
But Scott was looking at his feet. His worn shoes
were crusted heavily with alkali mud. &#8220;What do
you want with me?&#8221; snarled the man halted at
the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you,&#8221; said Scott, &#8220;for burning Point
of Rocks station night before last. Here, partner,&#8221;
he continued, speaking to the waiter. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
pay for these two breakfasts; search that man
for me,&#8221; he continued, pointing to the man in
the overalls.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Search him yourself,&#8221; returned the waiter stolidly.
Scott turned like a wolf.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; Another expression stole over
his good-natured face. Holding his revolver to
cover any one that resisted, he turned his accusing
finger upon the insolent waiter. &#8220;You will
talk to me, will you?&#8221; he demanded sharply.
&#8220;Do as I tell you instantly, or I&#8217;ll drive you out
of camp and burn your shack to the ground.
When I talk to you, General Jack Casement talks,
and this railroad company talks. Search that
man!&#8221;</p>
<p>Before the last word had passed his lips the
waiter jumped over the counter and began turning
the pockets of the man in the new overalls
inside out. The fellow kept a good face even
after a bunch of stolen railroad tickets were discovered
in one pocket. &#8220;A man gave them to
me last night to keep for him,&#8221; he answered
evenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; returned Scott with indifference,
&#8220;I will take care of them for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The news of the capture spread over the camp,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
and when Scott with his two prisoners walked
across to General Casement&#8217;s tent a crowd followed.
Stanley had just arrived from Point of
Rocks by train and was conferring with Casement
when Scott came to the tent door. He greeted
Bob and surveyed the captured fugitives.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you get them?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>Scott smiled and hung his head as he shook
it, to anticipate compliments. &#8220;They just walked
into my arms. Dave Hawk and the troopers are
looking for these fellows now away down on
Bitter Creek. They wandered into camp here last
night to save us the trouble of bringing them.
Isn&#8217;t that it, Rebstock?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rebstock disavowed, but not pleasantly. He
was not in amiable mood.</p>
<p>&#8220;What show has a fat man got to get away
from anybody?&#8221; he growled.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>
<p>When Hawk saw Bob Scott, two hours later,
riding into his camp on the Brushwood with the
two prisoners, he was taciturn but very much
surprised.</p>
<p>Scott was disposed to make light of the lucky
chance, as he termed it, that had thrown the two
men into his way. Hawk, on the other hand,
declared in his arbitrary manner that it was not
wholly a lucky chance. He understood the Indian&#8217;s
dogged tenacity too well to think for a moment
that the fugitives could have escaped him,
even had he not ridden into Casement&#8217;s camp
as he so fortuitously had done.</p>
<p>The scout, Hawk knew, had the characteristic
intuition of the frontiersman; the mental attributes
that combine with keen observation and
unusually good judgment as aids to success when
circumstances are seemingly hopeless. Such men
may be at fault in details, and frequently are, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
they are not often wholly wrong in conclusions.
And in their pursuit of a criminal they are like
trained hounds, which may frequently lose their
trail for a moment, but, before they have gone
very far astray, come unerringly back to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they ever give you a chance, Bob, you will
make a great thief-catcher,&#8221; exclaimed Hawk with
his naturally prodigal generosity of appreciation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly never expected to catch Rebstock
and this fellow Seagrue as easily as that,&#8221; smiled
Scott, as the troopers took charge of his men.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you hadn&#8217;t caught them there you would
have trailed them there. It would only have
meant a longer chase.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A whole lot longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you come to think of it, Bob, the railroad
was their only hope, anyway. They did
right in striking for it. Without horses, the big
camp and the trains for Medicine Bend every day
were their one chance to get away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott assented. &#8220;The trouble with us,&#8221; he
smiled, &#8220;was that we didn&#8217;t think until after it
was all over. Sometime a man will come to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
these mountains who thinks things out before
they happen instead of after. Then we will have
a man fit to run the secret service on this railroad.
But we are losing time,&#8221; he added, tightening
up his saddle girths.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do now? And why,&#8221;
demanded Hawk without waiting for an answer,
&#8220;did you drag these men away down here instead
of leaving them for Casement to lock up until we
were ready to take them to Medicine Bend?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to drag them farther yet,&#8221; announced
Scott. &#8220;I am going to ride after the
French trader and fit these two fellows out in
their own clothes again to make it easier for
Bucks to indentify them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say &#8216;indentify,&#8217; Bob, say &#8216;identify,&#8217;&#8221;
returned Hawk testily.</p>
<p>Bob Scott usually turned away a sharp word
with silence, and although he felt confident Hawk
was wrong, he argued no further with him, but
stuck just the same to his own construction of
the troublesome word.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got the right idea, Bob, if you have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
got the wrong word,&#8221; muttered Hawk. &#8220;Why
didn&#8217;t you think of that sooner?&#8221;</p>
<p>They broke camp and started promptly. About
noon they overtook the trading outfit and after
some threatening forced the tricky teamster to
rig the two gamblers out in their own apparel.
Having done this, they started on a long ride for
Casement&#8217;s camp, reaching it again with their
prisoners, and all very dusty and fatigued, long
after dark.</p>
<p>The hard work voluntarily undertaken by the
scout to aid the boy, as he termed Bucks, in identifying
his graceless assailants was vindicated when,
the next morning, the party with their prisoners
arrived on a special train at Point of Rocks, and
Bucks immediately pointed to Seagrue as the man
who had first fired at him.</p>
<p>There were a few pretty hot moments on the
platform when Bucks, among a group of five camp
malefactors on their way to Medicine Bend, confronted
the two men who had tried to kill him,
and unhesitatingly pointed them out. Seagrue,
tall and surly, denied vehemently ever having been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
at Point of Rocks and ever having seen Bucks.
He declared the whole affair was &#8220;framed up&#8221; to
send him to the penitentiary. He threatened if he
were &#8220;sent up&#8221; to come back and kill Bucks if
it was twenty years later&ndash;&ndash;and did, in that respect,
try to keep his word.</p>
<p>But his threats availed him nothing, and John
Rebstock who, though still young, was a sly fox
in crooked ways, contented himself with a philosophical
denial of everything alleged against him,
adding only in an injured tone that nobody would
believe a fat man anyway.</p>
<p>It was he, however, rather than the less clever
Seagrue, who had begun to excite sympathy for
what he called his luckless plight and that of his
companion, before they had left the railroad camp.
Among the five evil-doers who had been rounded-up
and deported for the jail at Medicine Bend,
and now accompanied the two gamblers, Rebstock
spread every story he could think of to
arouse his friends at Medicine Bend to a demonstration
in his behalf.</p>
<p>The very first efforts at putting civil law and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
order into effect were just then being tried in
the new and lawless frontier railroad town and
the contest between the two elements of decency
and of license had reached an acute pass when
Rebstock and Seagrue were thrown into jail at
Medicine Bend. A case of sympathy for them
was not hard to work up among men of their
own kind and threats were heard up and
down Front Street that if the railroading of
two innocent men to the penitentiary were
attempted something would happen.</p>
<p>Railroad men themselves, hearing the mutterings,
brought word of them to head-quarters,
but Stanley was in no wise disturbed. He had
wanted to make an example for the benefit of the
criminals who swarmed to the town, and now
welcomed the chance to put the law&#8217;s rigor on
the men that had tried to assassinate his favorite
operator. Bucks, lest he might be made the victim
of a more successful attack, was brought
down from Point of Rocks the first moment he
could be relieved. A plot to put him out of the
way, as the sole witness against the accused gamblers,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
was uncovered by Scott almost as soon as
Bucks had returned to the big town and, warned
by his careful friend, he rarely went up street
except with a companion&ndash;&ndash;most frequently with
Scott himself.</p>
<p>As the day set for Rebstock&#8217;s trial drew near,
rumors were heard of a jail delivery. The jail
itself was a flimsy wooden affair, and so crude in
its appointments that any civilized man would
have been justified in breaking out of it.</p>
<p>Nor was Brush, the sheriff, much more formidable
than the jail itself. This official sought to
curry favor with the townspeople&ndash;&ndash;and that meant,
pretty nearly, with the desperadoes&ndash;&ndash;as well as to
stand well with the railroad men; and in his effort
to do both he succeeded in doing neither.</p>
<p>Bucks was given a night trick on his old wire
in the local station, and in spite of the round of
excitement about him settled down to the routine
of regular work. The constant westbound movement
of construction material made his duties
heavier than before, but he seemed able to do
whatever work he was assigned to and gained
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
the reputation of being dependable, wherever
put.</p>
<p>He had risen one night from his key, after despatching
a batch of messages, to stir the fire&ndash;&ndash;the
night was frosty&ndash;&ndash;when he heard an altercation
outside on the platform. In another moment
the waiting-room door was thrown open
and Bucks turned from the stove, poker in hand,
to see a man in the extremity of fear rush into his
lonely office.</p>
<p>The man, hatless and coatless and evidently
trying to escape from some one, was so panic-stricken
that his eyes bulged from their sockets,
and his beard was so awry that it was a moment
before Bucks recognized his old acquaintance
Dan Baggs.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are after me, Bucks,&#8221; cried Baggs, closing
the door in desperation. &#8220;They will kill me&ndash;&ndash;hide
me or they&#8217;ll kill me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before the operator could ask a question in
explanation, almost before the words were out of
the frightened engineman&#8217;s mouth, and with Bucks
pointing with his poker to the door, trying to tell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
Baggs to lock it, the door again flew open and
Bucks saw the face of a Front Street confidence
man bursting through it.</p>
<p>Bucks sprang forward to secure the door behind
the intruder, but he was too late even for
that. Half a dozen more men crowded into the
room. To ask questions was useless; every one
began talking at once. Baggs, paralyzed with
fear, cowered behind the stove and the confidence
man, catching sight of him, tried to crowd through
the wicket gate. As he sprang toward it, Bucks
confronted him with his poker.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let that gate alone or I&#8217;ll brain you,&#8221; he cried,
hardly realizing what he was saying, but well resolved
what to do.</p>
<p>The gambler, infuriated, pointed to Baggs.
&#8220;Throw that cur out here,&#8221; he yelled.</p>
<p>Baggs, now less exposed to his enemies, summoned
the small remnant of his own courage and
began to abuse his pursuer.</p>
<div class='figtag'>

<p class='caption'>
&#8220;LET THAT GATE ALONE OR I&#8217;LL BRAIN YOU,&#8221; HE CRIED.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>Bucks, between the two men with his poker,
tried to stop the din long enough to get information.
He drew the enraged gambler into a
controversy of words and used the interval to step
to his key. As he did so, Baggs, catching up a
monkey-wrench that Bucks ordinarily used on his
letter-press, again defied his enemy.</p>
<p>It was only a momentary burst of courage, but
it saved the situation. Taking advantage of the
instant, Bucks slipped the fingers of his left hand
over the telegraph key and wired the despatchers
upstairs for help. It was none too soon. The men,
leaning against the railing, pushed it harder all
along the line. It swayed with an ominous crack
and the fastening gave way. Baggs cowered. His
pursuers yelled, and with one more push the
railing crashed forward and the confidence man
sprang for the engineer. Baggs ran back to where
Bucks stood before his table, and the latter,
clutching his revolver, warned Baggs&#8217;s pursuers
not to lay a hand on him.</p>
<p>Defying the single-handed defender, the gambler
whipped out his own pistol to put an end to
the fight. It was the signal for his followers, and
in another minute half a dozen guns covered
Bucks and his companion.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></div>
<p>Seconds meant minutes then. Bucks understood
that only one shot was needed as the signal
for his own destruction. What he did not quite
realize was that the gambler confronting him and
his victim read something in Bucks&#8217;s eye that
caused him to hesitate. He felt that if a shot
were fired, whatever else happened, it would mean
his own death at Bucks&#8217;s hand. It was this that
restrained him, and the instant saved the operator&#8217;s
life.</p>
<p>He heard the clattering of feet down the outside
stairway, and the next moment through the
open door on the run dashed Bill Dancing, swinging
a piece of iron pipe as big as a crowbar. The
yardmaster, Callahan, was at his heels, and the
two, tearing their way through the room, struck
without mercy.</p>
<p>The thugs crowded to the door. The narrow
opening choked with men trying to dodge the
blows rained upon them by Dancing and Callahan.
Before Baggs could rub his eyes the room
was cleared, and half a dozen trainmen hastily
summoned and led by a despatcher were engaged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
out upon the platform in a free fight with the
Front Street ruffians.</p>
<p>Within the office, the despatcher found Bucks
talking to Callahan, while Baggs was trying to
explain to Bill Dancing how the confidence men
had tried to inveigle him into a &#8220;shell&#8221; game and,
when they found they could not rob him of his
month&#8217;s pay in any other way, had knocked him
down to pick his pockets.</p>
<p>Callahan, who knew the trouble-making element
better than any of the railroad men, went
up town to estimate the feeling after the fight,
which was now being discussed by crowds everywhere
along Front Street. For every bruised and
sore head marked by the punishment given by
Dancing in the defence of Baggs a new enemy
and an active one had been made.</p>
<p>Stanley came in late from the west and heard
the story of the fight. His comment was brief
but significant. &#8220;It will soon be getting so they
won&#8217;t wait for the railroad men to draw their
pay. They will come down here,&#8221; said he ironically,
&#8220;to draw it for them.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
</div>
<p>A second and more serious disturbance followed
close on the fight at the railroad station.
A passenger alighting in the evening from a westbound
train was set upon, robbed, and beaten into
insensibility within ten feet of the train platform.
A dozen other passengers hastened to his assistance.
They joined in repulsing his assailants and
were beating them off when other thugs, reinforcing
their fellows, attacked the passengers and
those railroad men that had hurried up to drive
off the miscreants.</p>
<p>In the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, a brakeman was shot through the
head and a second passenger wounded. But the
railroad men rallied and, returning the pistol fire,
drove off the outlaws.</p>
<p>The train was hurried out of town and measures
were taken at once to defend the railroad property
for the night. Guards were set in the yards,
and a patrol established about the roundhouse,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
the railroad hotel and the eating-house and
freight-houses.</p>
<p>Stanley, with his car attached to the night passenger
train, was on his way to Casement&#8217;s camp
when the fight occurred, and had taken Bucks
with him. The despatch detailing the disturbance
reached him at a small station east of
Point of Rocks, where he was awakened and the
message was read to him advising the manager
of the murder of the brakeman.</p>
<p>A freight-train, eastbound, stood on the passing
track. Stanley roused Bucks and, notifying the
despatchers, ordered the engine cut off from the
freight-train, swung up into the cab, and started
for Medicine Bend. As they pulled out, light,
Stanley asked for every notch of speed the lumbering
engine could stand, and Oliver Sollers, the
engineman, urged the big machine to its limit.</p>
<p>The new track, laid hastily and only freshly ballasted,
was as rough as corduroy, and the lurching
of the big diamond stack made the cab topple at
every rail joint. But Sollers was not the runner
to lose nerve under difficulties and did not lessen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
the pressure on the pistons. If Stanley, determined
and silent, his lips set and hanging on for
dear life as the cab jumped and swung under him,
felt any qualms at the dangerous pace he had
asked for, he betrayed none. With Bucks, open-eyed
with surprise, hanging on in front of him,
Stanley gave no heed to the bouncing, and the
freight-engine pounded through the mountains
like a steam-roller with a touch of crushed-stone
delirium. Hour after hour the wild pace was
kept up through the Sleepy Cat Mountains and
across the Sweet Grass Plains. There was no easing
up until the frantic machine struck the gorge
of the Medicine River and whistled for the long
yards above the roundhouse.</p>
<p>Things had so quieted down by the time Stanley,
springing up the stairs two steps at a time,
reached the despatchers&#8217; office, that they were
sorry they had sent in such haste for him. Stanley
himself had no regrets. He knew better than
those about him the temper of the crowd he had
to deal with and felt that he needed every minute
to prepare for what he had to do. Bucks was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
sent to bring in Dancing, Bob Scott, and the more
resolute among the railroad men. A brief consultation
was held, and the attitude of the gamblers
carefully discussed.</p>
<p>Scott, who had been up town since the murder,
had collected sufficient proof that the chief outlaw,
Levake, had done the shooting, and Stanley
now sent Scott to Brush, the sheriff, with a verbal
message demanding Levake&#8217;s arrest.</p>
<p>Every man that heard the order given knew
what it meant. Every one that listened realized
it was the beginning of a fight in which there
could be no retreat for Stanley; that it would be
a fight to a finish, and that no man could say
where it would end.</p>
<p>Bob Scott hitched his trousers at the word from
his sandy-haired chief. For Bob, orders meant
orders and the terror of Levake&#8217;s name in Medicine
Bend had no effect on him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You might as well ask a jack-rabbit to tackle
a mountain lion as to try to get Brush to arrest
Levake,&#8221; declared Dave Hawk cynically.</p>
<p>But Stanley&#8217;s hand struck the table like a hammer:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
&#8220;We are going to have a show-down here.
We will go through the forms; this is the beginning&ndash;&ndash;and
I am going to follow it to the end. Either
Levake has got to quit the town or I have.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dave Hawk looked around with a new idea.
He bent his eyes on Bob: &#8220;Better get Brush to
deputize <i>you</i> to make the arrest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is it!&#8221; exclaimed Stanley. &#8220;Get him
to deputize you, Bob, and we will clean up this
town as it hasn&#8217;t been cleaned since the flood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott shook his head: &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe Brush
has the sand for that. We will see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Up Front Street, through the various groups of
men still discussing the events of the evening,
Scott, followed only by Bill Dancing, made his
way, nodding and patiently or pleasantly grinning
as the greetings or ridicule of the crowd
were thrown at him. He went to the rooms of
the sheriff only to find them locked, and made his
way down town again looking through the resorts
in a search for Brush.</p>
<p>After much trouble, he found him at a gaming-table,
inclined to appear sceptical as to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
story that Levake had killed an unoffending
brakeman. When Scott repeated Stanley&#8217;s demand
that Levake be arrested, the sheriff slammed
down his cards and declared he would not be
made a cat&#8217;s-paw for any man; that the brakeman,
according to accounts reaching him, had
been killed in a fair fight and he would hear no
more of it. Then, as if his game had been unreasonably
interfered with and his peace of mind
injured, he rose from the table to relieve his annoyance.</p>
<p>Meantime Bill Dancing slipped into his vacated
seat, picked up the discarded hand of cards
and announced it was too good to throw away.
&#8220;Will anybody,&#8221; Bill asked dryly, &#8220;play the
hand with me while Brush is arresting Levake?&#8221;
The laugh of Brush&#8217;s own companions at this proposal
stung him as an imputation of his cowardice,
and he made an additional display of rage
to counteract the unconcealed contempt in which
his cronies held him.</p>
<p>He turned on Scott angrily. &#8220;Go arrest the
man yourself, if you want him,&#8221; he thundered.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></div>
<p>Scott snapped up the suggestion. He pointed
a lean finger at the shifty peace officer. &#8220;Deputize
me to do it, if you dare, Brush!&#8221; he softly
exclaimed, fixing his brown eyes on the flushed
face of the coward.</p>
<p>Not a man in the room moved or spoke. Brush
saw himself trapped. Scott&#8217;s finger called for
an answer and the sheriff found no escape. &#8220;I
knew you hadn&#8217;t the nerve to give me a deputy&#8217;s
badge,&#8221; laughed Scott, to spur the man&#8217;s lagging
courage; &#8220;you are too afraid of Levake.&#8221;</p>
<p>The taunt had its effect. Brush raved about
his courage, and Bill Dancing, slapping him ferociously
on the back, convinced him that he really
was a brave man. Taken volubly in tow by
the two railroad emissaries, who were far from
being as simple as they seemed, Brush returned
to his lodgings at the jail to issue the coveted
paper authorizing Scott to serve any warrants in
his stead.</p>
<p>Before the ink was dry on the certificate the
word had gone down Front Street, and the town
knew that Levake&#8217;s arrest was in prospect. As
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
Dancing and Scott left the jail and walked down
to the station, they were surrounded by a curious
throng of men watching for further developments
in the approaching crisis of the struggle with outlawry
in the railroad town.</p>
<p>The night was far advanced, but a third element
was now to make itself felt in the situation.
The decent business men had already seen the
approach of the storm and resolved on protecting
their own interests, which they realized were on
the side of law and order. Word had been passed
from one to another of a proposed meeting. It
was held toward daybreak in a secret place. One
and all present were pledged to act together under
a leadership then and there agreed upon, and after
so organizing, with a resolute merchant named Atkinson
at their head, and with a quiet that foreboded
no good to the gamblers and outlaws, the
men who had gone to the rendezvous as business
men left it as vigilantes, banded together to defend
their rights and property against the lawless element
that had terrorized legitimate business.</p>
<p>In the morning secret word was brought by
Atkinson to Stanley of the resolve of the new
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
allies to stand by him in his efforts to rid the
town of its undesirables for good and all. It was
welcome intelligence, and the railroad chief
assured the plucky merchant of his hearty cooperation
in the designs of the newly constituted
law-and-order committee.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the machinery of the law has miserably
failed to protect our lives and property,&#8221; he said
concisely, &#8220;we have nothing left for it but to protect
them ourselves.&#8221; Arms had been telegraphed
for and every effort made to secure troops in the
emergency. But the Indian uprising had taken
every available infantryman and trooper into the
north and there was not now sufficient time to
get them together for action. The railroad men,
Stanley knew, must depend on themselves and
upon such assistance as the decent element in the
town could render.</p>
<p>Meantime the outlaws were not idle. They
spent the day whipping the gamblers and their
hangers-on into line, upon the prediction that
if they themselves were dispersed scant quarter
would be shown their disorderly associates.</p>
<p>Scott spent the day leisurely. Stanley had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
asked him not to move until his own arrangements
for a defensive fight were completed. That
the outlaws had secret sources of information even
in the railroad circles, came out startlingly. A
special train&ndash;&ndash;an express car pulled by an engine&ndash;&ndash;entered
the railroad yard at dusk that evening,
when a party of men running out from the cover
of the freight warehouse attempted to rush it for
arms and ammunition.</p>
<p>They were met at the car doors by six of the
best men that could be picked up along the line
during the day run of the special across the plains.
Stanley had wired instructions to head-quarters to
send him six men that feared neither smoke nor
powder, and six stalwarts taken on at Grand Island,
North Platte, and Julesburg guarded the
car and tumbled like cats out of a bag upon the
surprised raiders.</p>
<p>The encounter was spirited, but it took only a
moment to convince the assaulting party that
they had made a mistake. Clubbing their heavy
revolvers, the guards, any one of whom in close
quarters could account for two ordinary men,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
threw themselves from the car step directly into
the crowd and struck right and left. There was
no regard for persons, and in the half-dark the
Medicine Bend ruffians, surprised and confused,
were soon fighting one another.</p>
<p>But one-sided as the contest was, it did not go
fast enough to suit the guards, who, seizing the
clubs thrown away by the rabble, charged them
in a line and drove them up the street. Railroad
men who came running from the station to help
were too late. The flurry was over and they
found nothing to do but to cheer their new
aids.</p>
<p>Nor were the gamblers asleep. Word had gone
out both east and west of the approaching crisis
between the disorderly and the law-and-order
elements, and every passenger train into Medicine
Bend brought mysterious men from towns and
railroad camps who were openly or secretly allied
in one or another vicious calling to the classes
that were now making a stand for the rule or
ruin of the railroad town.</p>
<p>A mob of sympathizers gathered in Front Street
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
to protect from further punishment the party that
had tried to capture the express car. But the
railroad men had no idea of pursuing the raiders
beyond the yard limits, and indeed were restrained
by strict orders from doing so. Stanley sent word
immediately to the sheriff, demanding the arrest
of the new peace-disturbers, but the sheriff no
longer made a pretence of arresting law-breakers.
In Front Street, the mob, emboldened by their
apparent control of the situation and increasing
in clamor and numbers, were now in a humor
for anything that promised pillage or vengeance.
There were still among them a few cool-headed
criminals who counselled caution, but these were
hooted down by men who had never tasted the
rigor of vigilante rule.</p>
<p>Out of a dozen wild schemes broached by as
many wild heads of the excited crowd, in which
were now lined up for any lawlessness all the
idlers, floaters, the improvident, and the reckless
elements of a frontier gambling town, one caught
the popular fancy. Some one proposed a jail
delivery to release Rebstock and Seagrue, persecuted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
by the railroad company. The idea spread
like wildfire, and a score of men, reinforced by
more at every door as they proceeded up Front
Street, made their way to the jail.</p>
<p>Fast as they came, time was given for word to
the sheriff, who conveniently got out of the way,
and, led by half a dozen men with crowbars and
spike-mauls, the outlaws surrounded and overran
the jail yard and without a show of resistance
from any one began smashing in the entrance and
battering down the cell doors.</p>
<p>The first suggestion included only the delivery
of the two men. But this was effected so easily
that more was undertaken. The jail at Medicine
Bend, being the only one within many miles in
any direction, harbored the criminals of the whole
mountain region, and these now cried to friendly
ears for their own freedom. Cell after cell was
battered open and the released criminals, snatching
tools from the mob, led in the fight to free
their fellows. In less than half an hour every
cell had been emptied and a score of hardened
malefactors had been added to the mob, which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
now proposed to celebrate the success of its undertaking
by setting fire to the jail itself.</p>
<p>The vigilantes down town, though taking the
alarm, had moved too slowly. A jail delivery
meant, they knew, that their stores would be
looted, and, under the leadership of Atkinson,
they attempted to avert the mischief impending.</p>
<p>Gathering twenty-five determined men, they
started with a shout for the hill, only to see the
sky already lighting with the flames of the burning
building. The mob, not understanding at
first, welcomed the new-comers with a roar of
approval.</p>
<p>But they were soon undeceived. The vigilantes
began to try to save the jail and their efforts
brought about the first clash of a night destined
long to be remembered in Medicine Bend. The
brawlers in the crowd stayed to fight the vigilantes.
The thieves and night-birds fell away in
the darkness, and like black cats scurried down
town to pillage the stores and warehouses of the
fire-fighters on the hill.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span></div>
<p>The few clerks and watchmen defending the
stores, these knaves made short work of. Dancing
and Scott, with Stanley, Bucks, and a party
of railroad men, uneasy at the reports from the
jail and now able to see the sky reddening with
the flames, moved in and out of the gloom of side
streets to keep track of the alarming situation
and were the earliest to discover the looting movement.</p>
<p>A convenient general store at Front and Hill
Streets was the first to be pillaged. Dancing
wanted to lead a party against the looters, but
Stanley pointed out the folly of half a dozen men
trying to police the whole street.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can do nothing here, Bill. Those vigilantes
have no business on the hill. Get word to
them, if you can, that the stores are being robbed.
They can&#8217;t save the jail; they ought to come
back and save their own property. I can&#8217;t bring
men up from the roundhouse. We&#8217;ve got to
protect our own property first. If we could get
word to them&ndash;&ndash;but a man never could get through
that mob to the jail.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I can, colonel,&#8221; said Bill Dancing,
throwing off his coat.</p>
<p>&#8220;They will kill you, Bill,&#8221; predicted Stanley.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; growled the lineman, rolling up his shirt
sleeves. &#8220;Not me. I wouldn&#8217;t stand for it.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
</div>
<p>Slipping away behind the long warehouses in
Front Street and moving swiftly in and out of
friendly shadows on his long journey up the hill,
Dancing started for the jail. He was hardly more
than well under way when he was aware of one
following him and, turning to fell him with his
fist, he started as he found it was Bucks.</p>
<p>The latter confronted him coolly: &#8220;Go ahead,
Bill; I am going with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who said you could go?&#8221; exclaimed the lineman.
&#8220;You can&#8217;t. Go back!&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucks stood his ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want to get killed?&#8221; thundered Dancing
hotly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two are better than one on a job like this,&#8221;
returned Bucks, without giving way. &#8220;Go on,
will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>With a volley of grumbling objections, Dancing
at length directed Bucks to stick close to him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
whatever happened, and to fight the best he could
in case they were cornered.</p>
<p>Ahead of them the glare of the conflagration
lighted the sky and the air was filled with the
shouts of the mob surrounding the fighting vigilantes.
Only half a block away, men were hurrying
up and down Front Street, while the two clambered
along the obscure and half-opened street
leading to the jail and parallel to the main thoroughfare.</p>
<p>Dancing, to whom every foot of the rocky way
was familiar and who could get over obstructions
in the dark as well as if it were day, led the way
with a celerity that kept his companion breathing
fast. Both had long legs, but Dancing in some
mysterious way planted his feet with marvellous
certainty of effect, while Bucks slipped and floundered
over rocks and brush piles and across gullies
until they took a short cut through a residence
yard and found themselves on the heels of
the mob surrounding the burning jail and in the
glare of the fire in upper Front Street.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stick close, sonny,&#8221; muttered the lineman,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
&#8220;we must push through these fellows before they
reco&#8217;nize us.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stooped as he spoke and picked up a piece
of hickory&ndash;&ndash;the broken handle of a spike-maul.
&#8220;Railroad property anyway,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;It
might come handy. But gum shoes for us now
till we are forced. Perhaps we can sneak all the
way through.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without further ado Dancing, with Bucks on
his heels, elbowed his way into the crowd. The
outer fringe of this he knew was not dangerous,
being made up chiefly of onlookers. But in another
minute the two were in the midst of a
yelling, swaying mix-up between the aggressive
mob and a thin fringe of vigilantes, who, hard-pressed,
had abandoned the jail to its fate and
were trying to fight their way down town.</p>
<p>Dancing, like a war-horse made suddenly mad
by smoke of battle, throwing caution and strategy
to the winds, suddenly released a yell and began
to lay about him. His appearance in the fray
was like that of a bombshell timed to explode
in its midst. The slugging gamblers turned in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
astonishment on the new fighting man, but they
were not long left in doubt as to which cause
he espoused. In the next instant they were actively
dodging his flashing club, and the vigilantes
encouraged as if by an angel fought with fresh
vigor.</p>
<p>Bucks was stunned by the suddenness of Bill&#8217;s
change of tactics. It was evident that he had
completely forgotten his mission and now meant
to enjoy himself in the unequal fray that he had
burst in upon. The vigilantes cried a welcome
to their new ally. But one cry rose above every
other and that was from Dancing&#8217;s own throat as
he laid about with his club.</p>
<p>Consternation seized the rioters and they were
thrown for a moment into confusion. They then
recognized Dancing and a shout went up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Railroad men!&#8221; cried a dozen of the mob at
once.</p>
<p>And above these cries came one wheezing but
stentorian voice: &#8220;You&#8217;ve got &#8217;em now; finish &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucks knew that voice. It was Rebstock.</p>
<p>The crowd took up the cry, but the lineman,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
swinging right and left with terrific strength and
swiftness, opened a way ahead of him while Bucks
kept close by till Dancing had cut through to
the vigilantes. Then, turning with them as they
raised their own cry of triumph, Dancing helped
to drive the discomfited rioters back.</p>
<p>It was only for a moment that the vigilantes
held their advantage. Outnumbering the little
band, the rioters closed in on their flanks and
showered stones upon them. Bill Dancing was
the centre of the fight. A piece of rock laid open
his scalp, but, though the mob was sure of getting
him, he fought like a whirlwind. They redoubled
their efforts to bring him down. One active rioter
with the seam of some other fight slashed across
his forehead struck down a vigilante and ran
in on Dancing. It was Seagrue. The lineman,
warned by Bucks, turned too late to escape a
blow on the head that would have dazed a bullock.
But Dancing realized the instant he received
the blow that Seagrue had delivered it.</p>
<p>He whirled like a wounded bear and sprang
at Seagrue, taking upon his shoulder a second
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
blow hardly less terrific than the first. Before
Seagrue could strike again, Dancing was upon
him. Tearing at each other&#8217;s throats the two
men struggled, each trying to free his right arm.
Seagrue was borne steadily backward. Then the
lineman&#8217;s big arm shot upward and down like
a trip-hammer and Seagrue sunk limp to the
ground.</p>
<p>The vigilantes themselves, profiting by the momentary
diversion, got away. Bucks had seen the
peril of being separated from their friends, but he
was powerless to avert it. As Dancing struck
Seagrue down, his enemies closed in behind the
moving vigilantes. Bucks fought his way to the
lineman&#8217;s side and in another instant the two
were beset. Dancing, hard-pressed, made a dash
to break through the circle to liberty. Half a
dozen men sprang at him, and trampling Bucks
completely under foot aimed their blows at his
defender.</p>
<p>Dancing saw Bucks fall and, clubbing his way
to his side, caught Bucks from the ground by
the coat collar, and dragging him with his left
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
hand, swung with his right hand his deadly club.
Nothing less would have saved them. The fight,
moving every instant after Dancing, reached the
broad wooden steps leading from the jail yard to
the street. Down these the lineman, stubborn
and bleeding, drove a desperate way. And Bucks,
able again to handle himself, was putting up a
good fight when, to his horror, Dancing, fighting
down the flight of steps, stumbled and fell.</p>
<p>Half a dozen men, with a yell, jumped for him.
Bucks thought the finish had come. He sprang
into the fight and, armed only with a wagon spoke,
cracked right and left wherever he could reach a
head. Dancing he had given over for dead, when
to his astonishment the lineman rose out of the
heap about him, shaking off his enemies like rats.</p>
<p>Flames shooting up from the burning jail lighted
the scene. Dancing, bare-headed, and with only
a part of his shirt hanging in ribbons from his
left arm, his hair matted in blood across his forehead
and his eyes blazing, was a formidable sight.
He had lost his club but he was at no loss for a
weapon. It was said of Bill Dancing in later
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
days that he could lift a thirty-foot steel rail.
Bucks saw him now catch up a man scrambling
in front of him and swing him by the legs like a
battering ram. With this victim, he mowed down
men like corks, and, flinging the man at last bodily
into the faces of his friends, he started like a deer
up Cliff Street with Bucks at his heels.</p>
<p>Sure that they now had him, the rioters followed
in a swarm. Cliff Street, only a block
long and only half-opened, terminated then at
the cliffs above the gorge of the Medicine River.
But darkness under the brow of the hill helped
the fleeing railroad men. Dancing dodged in and
out of the undergrowth that fringed the street
line and eluding his pursuers reached the brow
of the cliff unseen. The rioters, knowing that no
escape lay in that direction, beat the bushes that
fringed the half-opened street, confident that the
fugitives were in hiding among them.</p>
<p>For an ordinary man, indeed, there was no
escape toward the river. A wall of rock fell a
hundred feet to the water&#8217;s edge. The crowd,
growing every moment as the word passed that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
Dancing was whipped, left the hunted man and
his companion little time for decision. Dancing,
in truth, needed but little. His purpose was fixed
the instant he saw himself cut off from every
other chance. He halted only on the brink of
the precipice itself. Catching Bucks&#8217;s arm, he
told him hurriedly what they must do and cautioned
him. &#8220;It&#8217;s the last chance, sonny,&#8221; he
murmured, as his iron fingers gripped the boy&#8217;s
arm. &#8220;We can make it&ndash;&ndash;if you do exactly as I
tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The gathering cries closed in behind them while
they were taking off their shoes. Creeping on his
hands and knees along the brow of the cliff, Dancing
felt out his location with his fingers. And
with that sixth sense of instinct which rises to
a faculty when dangers thicken about a resolute
man, the lineman found what he sought.</p>
<p>He caught at the root of a rock-bound cedar,
swung himself over the cliff, and called to Bucks
to follow. Bucks acted wholly on faith. The
blackness below was impenetrable, and perhaps
better so, since he could not see what he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
undertaking. Only the roar of the river came up
from the depths. It sounded a little ominous as
Bucks, grasping the cedar root, swung over and
after an agonizing instant felt a support for his
feet. He stood on a ledge of rock so narrow that
it gave only a footing even in daylight, but Bucks
was called on to descend it in the middle of the
night.</p>
<p>For any man to have attempted the feat seemed
to him, the next morning, sheer insanity. Dancing,
however, knew the treacherous face of the
river wall. To his gigantic size and strength he
united the sureness of a cat in climbing up or down
a mountain ar&ecirc;te. Often he had crept with a
telegraph wire, unaided, where his best men hung
back even in harness. There was, in fact, no
time now for halting. The rioters, eager on the
trail, were calling for torches, and, if discovered
before they reached the water, the lives of the
two men would be snuffed out by dropping rocks
on their heads.</p>
<p>Flattening himself as he had been bidden to
do and with his cheek laid to the face of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
sheer rock, clasping from time to time with his
outstretched left hand such slight uneven surfaces
as he could feel, Bucks moved to the right
after Dancing, who gripped his extended right
hand and led him foot by foot down the perilous
way. Not a word was spoken, hardly a breath
drawn, as the lineman felt for his slippery foothold
with the deftness of a gorilla, and, pressing Bucks&#8217;s
hand as the signal to take a follow step, he made
a slow but steady descent.</p>
<p>The roar of the river already sounded in Bucks&#8217;s
ears like a cataract, but the shock of extreme danger
had numbed his apprehension. Chips of the
sharp granite cut his feet like knives, and he knew
that the sticky feeling upon his bare soles was blood
oozing through the broken skin. He had already
given up expectation of ever leaving the gorge
alive and merely responded to his companion&#8217;s
will. The one thought that came to his mind
was curiosity as to what Dancing ever expected
to do if they reached the bottom without accident.</p>
<p>Suddenly above the roar of the river he heard
the muffled crack of fire-arms coming as if out of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
another world. He wondered whether they themselves
were already being fired at, but experienced
nothing more than curiosity in the thought. Only
the pressure of the big hand that gripped his own
impressed itself powerfully upon his consciousness,
and at each squeeze he put his foot forward
mechanically, intent on a dull resolve to obey
orders.</p>
<p>He presently felt a new signal from the long
fingers that wound around his own. He tried to
answer by stepping, but Dancing whose face was
turned away, restrained him. Then it flashed on
Bucks that the lineman was signalling Morse to
him, and that the dot-and-dash squeezes meant:
&#8220;Half-way down. Half-way down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucks answered with one word: &#8220;Hurrah!&#8221;
But he squeezed it along the nerves and muscles
like lightning.</p>
<p>He could hear the labored breathing of his
companion as he strained at intervals every particle
of his strength to reach a new footing of
safety. Every vine and scrubby bush down the
cliff wall was tested for its strength and root, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
Dancing held Bucks&#8217;s hand so that he could instantly
release it if he himself should plunge to
death.</p>
<p>Bucks had already been told that if this happened
he must hang as long as he could without
moving and if he could hold on till daylight he
would be rescued by railroad men. All this was
going through his head when, responding to a
signal to step down, and, unable to catch some
word that Dancing whispered, he stretched his
leg so far that he lost his balance. He struggled
to recover. Dancing called again sharply to him,
but he was too wrought up to understand. Dizziness
seized him, and resigning himself, with an
exclamation, to death, he felt himself dropping
into space.</p>
<p>In the next instant he was caught in Dancing&#8217;s
arms:</p>
<p>&#8220;Gosh darn it, why didn&#8217;t you jump, as I told
you?&#8221; exclaimed the lineman, setting him up on
his feet. &#8220;You pretty near clean upset us both.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are we, Bill?&#8221; muttered Bucks, swallowing
his shock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right here at the water, and them fellows
up there beating the bush for us. There&#8217;s shooting
down town, too. Some new deviltry. How
good a swimmer are you, Bucks? By gum, I
forgot to ask you before you started.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can swim better than I can climb, Bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve only a quarter of a mile and downstream
at that. And the current here would float
a keg of nails.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about rocks, Bill?&#8221; asked Bucks, peering
dubiously toward the roar of the rushing river.</p>
<p>&#8220;All up-stream from here,&#8221; returned Dancing,
edging down the shelving table toward the water.
&#8220;Lock arms with me so I don&#8217;t lose you, sonny.
What in Sam Hill is that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Far down the river the two saw a tongue of
flame leaping into the sky. They watched it for a
moment. Dancing was the first to locate the conflagration,
which grew now, even as they looked,
by leaps and bounds. The two stood ready to
plunge into the river when a fire of musketry
echoed up the gorge. The lineman clutched
Bucks&#8217;s arm.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></div>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s fighting going on down there now.
What&#8217;s that smokestack? By Jing, the roundhouse
is on fire!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
</div>
<p>They plunged together into the river. The
water, icy cold, was a shock, but Dancing had
made no mistake. They were below the rocks and
needed only to steady themselves as the resistless
current swept them down toward the railroad
yards.</p>
<p>Bucks demonstrated that he could swim and
the two seemed hardly in the water before they
could fully see the burning roundhouse. A moment
later, chilled to the bone but with his mind
cleared by the sharp plunge, Bucks felt his companion&#8217;s
arm drawing him toward the farther
shore where, in the slack water of an elbow of the
stream, Dancing led the way across a shoal of
gravel and Bucks waded after him up the riverbank.</p>
<p>They hastened together across the dark railroad
yard. The sound of firing came again from
the square in front of the railroad station and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
thither they directed their fleeing feet. To the
right they heard the shouts of the men who were
fighting the fire at the roundhouse and the hot
crackling of the flames. They reached the station
together and entered the waiting-room by
a rear door.</p>
<p>Men were running everywhere in and out of
the building and the waiting-room was barricaded
for war. Bill Dancing caught a passing trainman
by the arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going on here?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man looked at the lineman and his companion
in surprise: &#8220;The gamblers are driving
the vigilantes, Bill. They&#8217;ve got all Front Street.
What&#8217;s the matter with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dancing caught sight of Bob Scott coming
down the rear stairway with an armful of rifles,
and, without answering the question, called to
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; exclaimed Scott halting. He started
as he saw Bucks. &#8220;Were <i>you</i> with him? And
I&#8217;ve been scouring the town for you! Stanley
will have a word to say to you, youngster. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
thought the gamblers had you, Bill,&#8221; he added,
turning to the lineman.</p>
<p>Dancing, a sight from the pounding he had
taken, his clothing in tatters, and with the blood-stains
now streaked by the water dripping from
his hair, drew himself up. &#8220;I hope you didn&#8217;t
think so, Bob? Did they reckon a handful of
blacklegs would get me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott grinned inscrutably. &#8220;They&#8217;ve got the
best part of your shirt, Bill. How did you get
off?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Swam for it,&#8221; muttered Dancing, shaking
himself. &#8220;Where&#8217;s Stanley?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Out behind the flat cars. He is arming
the vigilantes. We&#8217;ve fenced off the yards with
loaded freight-cars. They&#8217;ve fired the roundhouse
on us, but the rifles and ammunition that
came to-night are upstairs here. Take some of
these guns, Bill, and hand them around in front.
Bucks can follow you with a box of ammunition.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott spoke hurriedly and ran out of the door
facing Front Street Square. A string of flat cars
had been run along the house-track in front of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
the station, and behind these the hard-pressed
vigilantes, reinforced now by the railroad men,
were taking up a new line of defence. Driven
through the town in a running battle, they were
in straits when they reached Stanley&#8217;s barricade.</p>
<p>Following a resolve already well defined, the
railroad chief conferred with the vigilante leaders
for a brief moment. He called them to his office
and denounced the folly of half-way measures.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; said Stanley, pointing to two dead
men whom the discomfited business men had
brought off with them, &#8220;what temporizing has done.
There is only one way to treat with these people.&#8221;
He was interrupted by firing from across
the square. &#8220;In an hour they will have every
store in Front Street looted.&#8221;</p>
<p>The deliberation for a few moments was a
stormy one, but Stanley held his ground. &#8220;Desperate
diseases, gentlemen,&#8221; he said, addressing
Atkinson and his companions, &#8220;require desperate
remedies, and you must sometime come to what
I propose.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What you propose,&#8221; returned Atkinson gloomily,
&#8220;will ruin us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stanley answered with composure: &#8220;You are
ruined now. What you should consider is
whether, if you don&#8217;t cut this cancer of gambling,
outlawry, and murder out while you have a
chance, it won&#8217;t remain to plague you as long
as you do business in Medicine Bend, and remain
to ruin you periodically. This is always going to
be a town and a big one. As long as this railroad
is operated, this ground where we stand is and
must be the chief operating point for the whole
mountain division. You and I may be wiped out
of existence and the railroad will go on as before.
But it is for you to accept or reject what I propose
as the riddance of this curse to your community.</p>
<p>&#8220;The railroad has been drawn into this fight
by assault upon its men. It can meet violence
with violence and protect itself, or it can temporarily
abandon a town where protection is not
afforded its lives and property. In an emergency,
trains could be run through Medicine Bend
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
without stopping. The right of way could be
manned with soldiers. But the railroad can&#8217;t
supply men enough to preserve in your town the
law and order which you yourselves ought to
preserve. And if we were compelled to build
division facilities, temporarily, elsewhere, while
they would ultimately come back here, it might
be years before they did so. What else but your
ruin would this mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>He had hardly ceased speaking when the conference
was broken in upon. Bob Scott ushered
in two men sent under a flag of truce from the
rioters. The offer they brought was that Rebstock
and Seagrue should be surrendered, provided
Stanley would give his personal pledge that
the two should not be shot but sent out of town
until peace was restored, and that they should be
accorded a fair trial when brought back.</p>
<p>Stanley listened carefully to all that was said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Who sent you?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;The committee up street,&#8221; returned the envoys
evasively.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean Levake sent you,&#8221; retorted Stanley.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
He sat at his desk and eyed the two ruffians,
as they faced him somewhat nervously. They at
length admitted that they had come from Levake,
and gave Stanley his chance for an answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell Levake for me there will be no peace for
him or his until he comes down here with his
hands behind his back. When I want Rebstock
and Seagrue I will let him know. I want him
first,&#8221; said Stanley, dismissing the messengers
without more ado.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />
<div class='chsp'>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
<a name='CHAPTER_XXIII' id='CHAPTER_XXIII'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
</div>
<p>He had resolved that Levake was to be punished,
but it was not a unanimous voice that
backed the railroad leader in his determination.
Weak-kneed men in the conference wanted to
compromise and end the fight where it stood.
Even Atkinson was disposed to make terms, as
the party returned to the barricade.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; repeated Stanley. &#8220;Levake is the head
and front of this whole disorder. As long as he
can shoot down unarmed men in the streets of
Medicine Bend there will be no law and order
here. While men see him walking these streets
unpunished they will take their cue from him and
rob and shoot whom they please&ndash;&ndash;Levake and his
ilk must go. A railroad, on the start, brings a
lawless element with it&ndash;&ndash;this is true. But it also
brings law and order and that element has come
to Medicine Bend to stay. If the machinery of
the law is too weak to support it, so much worse
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
for the machinery. I don&#8217;t want to see blood
shed or property destroyed, but the responsibility
for this rests with the outlaws that are terrorizing
this town. And I will spend every ounce of
ammunition I have and fight them to the last
man, rather than compromise with a bunch of
cutthroats.</p>
<p>&#8220;If any man here feels differently about this,
he may step out of the barricade now,&#8221; continued
Stanley, addressing those of the townsmen that
listened. &#8220;There will be no hard feeling. But
this is the time to do it. Worse is ahead of us
before we can clean the town up as it will have
to be cleaned sometime. The longer you leave
the job undone, the harder it will be when you
tackle it.&#8221;</p>
<p>A movement across the square interrupted his
words, and a messenger waving a white handkerchief
came over to the barricade to ask for a surgeon
for a wounded man. There were some who
opposed sending any relief to men that had forfeited
all claim to humane consideration. Doctor
Arnold, however, was summoned, and Stanley
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
finally determined that the matter should be left
to the surgeon himself&ndash;&ndash;he could go if he wished.
Arnold did not hesitate in his decision. &#8220;It is
my duty to go,&#8221; he decided briefly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite see that,&#8221; muttered Atkinson.</p>
<p>The white-haired surgeon turned to the leader
of the vigilantes. &#8220;It is not a matter of personal
inclination, Atkinson. When I took my
degree for the practice of medicine, I took an
oath to respond to every call of suffering and I
have no right to refuse this one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leaving his own injured with his assistant, the
surgeon told the messenger to proceed and the
two walked across the square and up Front Street
to the Three Horses. Arriving there, Arnold was
asked to dress the wound of a man that had been
shot through the breast in the fight along Fort
Street. While he was working over his patient,
who lay on a table surrounded by a motley
crowd of onlookers, Levake walked in. He nodded
to the surgeon and drawing a pocket knife,
while Arnold was cleansing the wound, sat down
beside him to whittle a stick.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I hear your man, Stanley, wants me,&#8221; began
Levake after an interval.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you hear right,&#8221; returned Arnold dryly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell him for me to come get me, will you?&#8221;
suggested Levake.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he ever comes after you, Levake, he will
get you,&#8221; returned Arnold, looking the outlaw
straight in the eye. &#8220;There isn&#8217;t any doubt
about that,&#8221; he added, resuming his task.</p>
<p>Levake whittled but made no reply. He
watched the surgeon&#8217;s work closely, and when
Arnold had finished and given directions for the
wounded man&#8217;s care he walked out of the place
with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell Stanley what I said, will you?&#8221; repeated
Levake, as the railroad surgeon left the door and
started down street.</p>
<p>Arnold made no answer and Levake, taunting
him to send all the men the railroad had after
him, followed Arnold toward the square.</p>
<p>The surgeon understood that it was Levake&#8217;s
purpose to engage him in a dispute and kill him
if he could. Arnold, moreover, was hot-tempered
and made no concealment of his feelings toward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
any man. For this reason, despite his realization
of danger, he was an easy prey.</p>
<p>To the final taunt of the outlaw the surgeon
made rather a sharp answer and quickened his
pace, to walk away from his unpleasant companion.
But Levake would not be shaken off,
and as the two were passing a deserted restaurant
he ordered the surgeon to halt. Arnold
turned without shrinking. Levake had already
drawn his pistol and his victim concluded he was
to be killed then and there, but he resolved to
tell the outlaw what he thought of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand your game perfectly, Levake,&#8221;
he said after he had raked him terrifically. &#8220;Now,
if you are going to shoot, do it. You haven&#8217;t
long to live yourself&ndash;&ndash;make sure of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No man can threaten me and live,&#8221; retorted
Levake harshly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came up here, an unarmed man, on an errand
of mercy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t send for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You would kill me just as quick if you had,
Levake. What are you hesitating about? If you
are going to shoot, shoot.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span></div>
<p>Throwing back his right arm, and fingering the
trigger of his revolver as a panther lashes his tail
before springing, Levake stepped back and to one
side. As he did so, with the fearless surgeon still
facing him, a man stepped from behind the screen
door of the deserted restaurant. It was Bob
Scott.</p>
<p>The old and deadly feud between the Indian
and the outlaw brought them now, for the first
time in months, face to face. In spite of his iron
nerve Levake started. Scott, slightly stooped and
wearing the familiar slouch hat and shabby coat in
which he was always seen, regarded his enemy with
a smile.</p>
<p>So sudden was his appearance that Levake
could not for an instant control himself. If there
was a man in the whole mountain country that
Levake could be said to be afraid of, it was the
mild-mannered, mild-spoken Indian scout. Where
Scott had come from, how he had got through
the pickets posted by Levake himself&ndash;&ndash;these questions,
for which he could find no answer, disquieted
the murderer.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span></div>
<p>Arnold, reprieved from death as by a miracle,
stood like a statue. Levake, with his hand on
his pistol, had halted, petrified, at the sight of
Scott.</p>
<p>The latter, eying the murderer with an expression
that might have been mistaken for friendly,
had not Levake known there could be no friendship
among decent men for him, broke the silence:
&#8220;Levake, I have a warrant for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The words seemed to shake the spell from the
outlaw&#8217;s nerves. He answered with his usual coolness:
&#8220;You&#8217;ve waited a good while to serve it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been a little busy for a few days, Levake,&#8221;
returned Scott, with the same even tone.
&#8220;I kind of lost track of you.&#8221; But his words
again disconcerted Levake. The few men who
now watched the scene and knew what was coming
stood breathless.</p>
<p>Levake, moistening his dry lips, spoke carefully:
&#8220;I don&#8217;t want any trouble with you here,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;When this town fight is over, bring
your warrant around and I&#8217;ll talk to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; returned Scott, undisturbed, &#8220;I might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
lose track of you again. You can come right
along with me, Levake.&#8221;</p>
<p>With incredible quickness the outlaw, half-turning
to cover Scott, fired. The cat-like agility
of the Indian answered the move in the instant
it was made. Scott was, in fact, the first scout
from whom mountain men learned to fire a revolver
without aiming it and it was not without
reason that Levake sought no encounter with
him. For Scott to draw and fire was but one
movement, and hating Levake as a monster, the
Indian had long been ready to meet him as he
met him now, when he should be forced to face
him fairly.</p>
<p>A fusillade of shots rang down the street. The
air between the two men, feinting like boxers in
their deadly duel, filled with whitish smoke. Arnold,
stunned by the suddenness of the encounter,
jumped out of range. In the next moment he
saw Levake sink to the sidewalk. Scott, springing
upon him like a cat, knelt with one hand already
on his throat; with the other he wrung a second
revolver from Levake&#8217;s hand. The surgeon ran
to the two men.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span></div>
<p>Levake, panting, lay desperately wounded, as
Scott slowly released his grip upon him. The
Indian rose as the surgeon approached, but Levake,
his eyes wide open, lay still.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are wounded, Bob,&#8221; cried Arnold, tearing
the stained sleeve of Scott&#8217;s coat from his
shoulder. The scout shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in danger here,&#8221; he replied, glancing
hurriedly up the street. &#8220;We must get this fellow
away.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two picked the wounded man from the
ground and started quickly down street with him.
The shooting, now so frequent all over the town,
had attracted little attention outside the few that
had witnessed the swift duel, and the two railroad
men made good progress with their burden before
the alarm was spread. But the surgeon saw that
the strain was telling on Scott, whose shoulder was
bleeding freely. He had even ordered his companion
to drop his burden and run, when he heard
a shout and saw Bill Dancing running across from
the barricade to their aid.</p>

FOR SCOTT TO DRAW AND FIRE WAS BUT ONE MOVEMENT.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>Half a dozen of the rioters, shouting threats and
imprecations, were hastening down Front Street
after Levake and his captors to rescue their prisoner.
Scott, reloading his revolver as Dancing
relieved him of his end of the burden, stood free
to cover the retreat. He fired a warning shot at
the nearest of their pursuers. A scattering pistol
fire at long range followed. But the railroad men
crossed the square in safety, and the big lineman,
with Levake in his arms, carried him single-handed
into the barricade.</p>
<p>The surgeon and Bob Scott followed close.
Bucks was first to meet the wounded scout, and
the railroad men, jubilant at Levake&#8217;s capture,
ran to Scott and bore him down with rough welcome.
Levake was laid upon a bench in the station
and Scott followed to his side. Arnold, joining
the scout, made ready to dress the wound in
his shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;See to Levake first, doctor,&#8221; said Scott, &#8220;he
needs it the most.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he spoke, Dancing hurried into the room.
&#8220;Bob, the car shops are on fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott ran to the east window. It was true.
The rioters, supplied with oil and torches, had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
made their way in the darkness through Callahan&#8217;s
picket line near the river and set fire to
the shops.</p>
<p>Stanley was eating a hasty supper in the despatchers&#8217;
office.</p>
<p>Within a few minutes the blaze could be seen
from all the east windows of the station. Almost
at the same moment, through the north windows
fire was seen breaking out in one of the big stores
in Front Street. As Stanley rose from his midnight
meal, Atkinson ran in with word that a
band of rioters, well armed, had attacked a train
of boarding-cars defended by the roundhouse men.</p>
<p>The sky, bright again with the flame of conflagration,
made a huge dome of red, lighting the
railroad yards across which men were now hurrying
to make fresh dispositions for the emergency.</p>
<p>The vigilante leaders saw impending, in the
Front Street fire, the ruin of their business property.
There were no longer men enough left to
fight the flames and guard the fire-fighters. A
point had been reached in which life and property
were no longer taken into account, and efforts to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
restore law and order were facing complete failure.
It was then that the most radical of all
measures, the last resort of organized society in
its resolve to defend itself, was discussed. The
vigilantes, as well as the railroad men, now realized
that but one measure remained for saving
Medicine Bend and that was the extermination
of the outlaws themselves.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XXIV' id='CHAPTER_XXIV'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
</div>
<p>The men in the barricade were lined up for
orders. Ammunition was passed and volunteers
were called to form a charging party. The vigilantes
formed in the glare of the burning shops.</p>
<p>From the head-quarters of the rioters in Front
Street came scattering shots and cries as a huge
volume of sparks shot up into the black sky. Ten
men under Hawk and ten under Dancing made the
supporting party for the vigilantes, who asked only
that a line of retreat be kept open. This Stanley
had undertaken to provide. Atkinson, making
a wide d&eacute;tour back of the station, led his men
down the railroad tracks and, reaching a point
where concealment was no longer possible, double-quicked
up Fort Street and charged with his party
across the little park.</p>
<p>They had already been seen. A line of men,
posted behind the places that line Front Street
at that point, opened fire. It was the worst possible
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
answer to make to men in the temper of the
scattered line that swept up the street in the
glare of the burning buildings. Wounded men
dropped out of the charge, but those that went
on carried with them a more implacable determination.
Re-forming their line under cover of the
cedars at the corner of Fort Street, they directed an
effective fire into the dance halls adjoining, and the
rioters hiding within scurried from them like rats.</p>
<p>But the vigilantes were intent first of all on
capturing and burning the hall known as the
Three Horses, and the rioters rallied to its defence.
As the place was assailed, the doors were
barred and a sharp fire was poured through the
windows. The assailants were driven back. Bill
Dancing, heated and stubborn, refused to retreat
and, picking up a sledge dropped by a fleeing
vigilante, attacked the barred doors single-handed.</p>
<p>The street, swept by the bullets of the fray, rang
with the splitting blows of the heavy hammer, as
the lineman, his long hair flying from his forehead,
swung at the thick panels. Within, the
gamblers tried to shoot him from the windows,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
but he stood close and his friends kept up a constant
supporting fire that drove the defenders back.</p>
<p>From above they hurled chairs and tables
down on Dancing, but his head seemed furniture-proof,
and scorning to waste time in dodging he
hammered away, undaunted, until he splintered
the panels and the stout lock-stiles gave. The
vigilantes, running up, tore through the door
chains with crowbars and rushed the building.</p>
<p>The fight in the big room lasted only a moment.
The rioters crowded toward the rear and escaped
as best they could. Vigilantes with torches made
short work of the rest of it. Dancing stove in a
cask of alcohol, and as the attacking party ran
out of the front door a torch was flung back into
the spreading pool.</p>
<p>A great burst of fire lighted the street. The
next moment the long building was in flames.</p>
<p>Emboldened by this success and driving the
outlaws from their further retreats, the vigilantes
fired one after another of the gaudy places that
lined the upper street. Met by close shooting at
every turn, the rioters were driven up the hill
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
and fighting desperately were pursued to cover by
men now as savage as themselves. The scattered
clashes were brief and deadly. The whole upper
town was on fire. Men fleeing for their lives
skulked in the shadows of the side streets and the
constant scattering report of fire-arms added to
the terrors of the night.</p>
<p>Hour after hour the conflagration raged and
day broke at last on the smoking ruins of the
town of Medicine Bend. The work of the vigilantes
had been mercilessly thorough. Along the
railroad track stiffened bodies hanging from the
cross-bars of telegraph poles in the gloom of the
breaking day told a ghastly story of justice summarily
administered to the worst of the offenders.
In the gloom of the smoking streets stragglers
roamed unmolested among the ruins; for of the
outlaws, killed or hunted out of the town, none
were now left to oppose the free passage of any
one from end to end of Medicine Bend.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
</div>
<p>The victory was dear, but none murmured at
its cost. Medicine Bend for once had been purged
of its parasites.</p>
<p>At the railroad head-quarters Stanley, before
daylight, was directing the resumption of operations
so interrupted by the three days of anarchism
on the mountain division. New men were added
every hour to the pay-roll, and the smaller tradesmen
of the town, ruined by the riots, were given
positions to keep them until the town could be
rebuilt.</p>
<p>The pressure on the operating department increased
twofold with the resumption of traffic.
Winter was now upon the mountains, but construction
could not be stopped for winter. The
enormous prizes for extending the line through
the Rockies to meet the rival railroad heading
east from California, spurred the builders to every
effort to lengthen their mileage, and something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
unheard of was attempted, namely, mountain
railroad-building in midwinter.</p>
<p>Levake, the leader among the mountain outlaws,
was nursed back to life by the surgeon he
had so nearly murdered. But his respite was a
brief one. When new officers of the law were
elected in Medicine Bend, the murderer was tried
for one of his many crimes and paid on the scaffold
the penalty of his cold-blooded cruelty. Rebstock,
the fox, and his companion Seagrue escaped
the exterminating raid of the vigilantes but
fought shy of Medicine Bend for long afterward.</p>
<p>A few days after the riots Stanley sent for
Bucks, who was holding a key among the operators
downstairs, to come to his office.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long have you been a telegraph operator,
Bucks?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>Bucks laughed in some embarrassment. &#8220;Since
I was about twelve years old, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Twelve years old!&#8221; echoed Stanley in amazement.
&#8220;Where did you learn to telegraph at
twelve?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucks hesitated again. &#8220;I never learned, sir!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to sit in the telegraph office of the
road when my uncle was superintendent, and I
got used to hearing the sound of the instruments.
I just woke up one morning and found I could
telegraph. I couldn&#8217;t the night before. That&#8217;s
the only way I ever learned, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stanley regarded the boy with interest. &#8220;How
old are you now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seventeen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. When you went to bed last night
you were not a train despatcher: this morning
you are.&#8221; Bucks started. &#8220;If any one ever asks
you,&#8221; continued Stanley dryly, &#8220;how you learned
to be a train despatcher, tell them just that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to think you are old enough
to be a despatcher,&#8221; continued Stanley, as Bucks
stammered his thanks, &#8220;for you are not. And I
don&#8217;t want you to think I like to make you one.
I don&#8217;t. Neither for your sake nor mine. I don&#8217;t
like to impose the responsibilities of a man on a
boy. But I can&#8217;t help it. We haven&#8217;t the men,
and we can&#8217;t get them&ndash;&ndash;and we must all, men
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
and boys, pull together and just do the best we
can&ndash;&ndash;do you understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand everything, Colonel Stanley.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I need not say much about what is before
you. You have been sending despatchers&#8217; orders
for years yourself. You know how many lives
are held every minute in the despatchers&#8217; hand.
Don&#8217;t overrate your responsibility and grow nervous
over it; and don&#8217;t ever underestimate it.
As long as you keep yourself fit for your work,
and do the best you can, you may sleep with a
clear conscience. Report to Mr. Baxter. Remember
you are working with green trainmen
and don&#8217;t expect too much of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Bucks signed a transfer and took his
train-sheet that night at twelve o&#8217;clock, his chief
anxiety was to keep the material trains going to
Casement and everything eastbound was laid out
in an effort to send the ties and rails west. Bucks
set himself to keep pace with the good work done
by the despatcher in the evening trick and for
two hours kept his sheet pretty clean.</p>
<p>A heavy train of rails which he had been helping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
all the way west after midnight was then at
Castle Springs, and Bucks gave its crew an order
to meet the eastbound passenger train at Point
of Rocks. It was three o&#8217;clock when a message
came from the operator at Point of Rocks, saying
the rail train had passed westbound. Bucks
seized a key and silencing the wires asked for
the passenger train. Nothing had been seen of it.
He called up Bitter Creek, the first telegraph point
west of Point of Rocks with an order to hold the
passenger train. But the train had already gone.</p>
<p>The new dispatcher sprang up from the table frantic.
Then, racing again to the key, he made
the operator at Castle Springs repeat the order
and assure him it had been delivered. Of this
there could be no question. The freight crew had
ignored or forgotten it, and were now past Point
of Rocks running head-on against the passenger
train. If the heavens had fallen the situation
would have seemed better to Bucks. A head-on
collision on the first night of his promotion meant,
he felt, his ruin. As he sat overwhelmed with despair,
trying to collect his wits and to determine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
what to do, the door opened and Bob Scott appeared.</p>
<p>The scout, with his unfailing and kindly smile,
advanced and held out his hand. &#8220;Just dropped
in to extend my congratulations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucks looked at him in horror, his face rigid
and his eyes set. Scott paused and regarded his
aspect with surprise. &#8220;Something has happened,&#8221;
he said, waiting for the despatcher to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bob!&#8221; exclaimed the boy in desperation, &#8220;No.
9 has run past her meeting order at Point of Rocks
with No. 2. They will meet head-on and kill
everybody. My God! what can I do?&#8221;</p>
<p>In the dim light of the shaded oil lamp, Bucks,
looking at the scout, stood the picture of despair.
Scott picked up the poker and began to stir the
fire and asked only a few questions and said
little. However, when Bucks told him he was
going to wake Stanley, whose sleeping-room adjoined
his office at the end of the hall, Scott counselled
no.</p>
<p>&#8220;He could do nothing,&#8221; said Scott reflecting.
&#8220;Let us wait a while before we do anything like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
that,&#8221; he added, coupling himself with the despatcher
in the latter&#8217;s overwhelming anxiety.
&#8220;The first news of the collision will come from
Bitter Creek. It will be time enough then to
call Stanley. Give your orders for a wrecking
crew, get a train ready, and get word to Doctor
Arnold to go with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucks, steadying himself under the kindly
common-sense of his older friend, followed each
suggestion promptly. Scott, who ordinarily would
himself have been running around on the job,
made no move to leave the room, thinking he
could be of more service in remaining with the
unfortunate despatcher. The yard became a scene
of instant activity. And although no organization
to meet emergencies of this kind had been
as yet effected on the new division, the men responded
intelligently and promptly with the necessary
arrangements.</p>
<p>Everyone summoned tried to get into the dispatchers&#8217;
room to hear the story repeated. Scott
took it upon himself to prevent this, and standing
in the anteroom made all explanations himself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
He rejoined Bucks after getting rid of the
crowd, and the moment the relief train reported
ready the despatcher sent it out, that help might
reach the scene of disaster at the earliest possible
moment. Bucks, calmed somewhat but suffering
intensely, paced the floor or threw himself into
his chair, while Scott picked up the despatcher&#8217;s
old copy of &#8220;The Last of the Mohicans,&#8221; and
smoking silently sat immovable, waiting with his
customary stoicism for the call that should announce
the dreaded wreck.</p>
<p>The moments loaded with anxiety went with
leaden feet while the two men sat. It seemed as
if the first hour never would pass. Then the long
silence of the little receiver was broken by a call
for the dispatcher. Bucks sprang to answer it.</p>
<p>Scott watched his face as he sent his &#8220;Ay,
ay.&#8221; Without understanding what the instruments
clicked, he read the expressions that
followed one after the other across Bucks&#8217;s countenance,
as he would have read a desert trail. He
noted the perplexity on the despatcher&#8217;s face when
the latter tried to get the sender of the call.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Some one is cutting in on the line,&#8221; exclaimed
Bucks, mystified, as the sounder clicked. &#8220;Bob,
it is Bill Dancing.&#8221;</p>
<p>A pause followed. &#8220;What can it mean, his
sending a message to me? He is between Bitter
Creek and Castle Springs. Wait a moment!&#8221;</p>
<p>The receiver clicked sharp and fast. Scarcely
able to control his voice in his anxiety, Bucks
turned to the now excited scout: &#8220;The trains
met between Bitter Creek and Castle Springs.
There was no collision!&#8221;</p>
<p>Almost collapsing with the passing of the strain,
Bucks faltered in his taking. Asking Dancing
again for the story, Bucks took it more coolly and
repeated it to his eager listener, as it came.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dancing was out with two men on the line
to-day, repairing between Bitter Creek and Castle
Springs. He didn&#8217;t get done and camped beside
the track for the night, to finish in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; exclaimed Scott.</p>
<p>&#8220;They shot a jack-rabbit&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hang the jack-rabbit,&#8221; cried Scott. &#8220;What
about the trains?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t hurry Bill Dancing, Bob,&#8221; pleaded
Bucks. &#8220;You know that. Faster, Bill, faster,&#8221;
he telegraphed urgently.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will get it faster,&#8221; returned the distant
lineman far out in the mountains under the stars,
as he talked calmly with the despatcher, &#8220;if you
will go slower.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucks strangled his impatience. Dancing resumed,
and the despatcher again translated for
Scott.</p>
<p>&#8220;They cooked the jack-rabbit for supper&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott flung his book violently across the room.
&#8220;It tasted good,&#8221; continued Dancing exasperatingly.
&#8220;But the night was awfully cold, so they
built a big camp-fire near the curve. The freight
engineer saw the fire and thought it was a locomotive
head-light. Then he remembered he had
run past his meeting point. He stopped his train
to find out what the fire was. When he told Bill
what had happened they grabbed up the burning
logs, carried them down the track, and built a
signal fire for No. 2. And it came along inside
five minutes&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span></div>
<p>&#8220;And there they are!&#8221; concluded Bucks, wiping
the dampness from his forehead.</p>
<p>The receiver continued to click. &#8220;Bill thought
I would be worried and he cut in on the line right
away to tell me what had happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now give your orders to No. 2 to back up
to Castle Springs and let the rail train get by.
Recall your relief train,&#8221; added Scott. &#8220;And
bring that freight engineer in here in the morning
and let Stanley talk to him for just about
five minutes.&#8221; The key rattled for a moment.
Scott, going to the farthest corner of the room,
picked up &#8220;The Last of the Mohicans.&#8221; &#8220;Bucks,&#8221;
he murmured insinuatingly, as he sat down
to look into the book again, &#8220;I want to ask
you now, once for all, whether this is a true
story?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bob, put that book where it belongs and stop
talking about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott hitched one shoulder a bit and returned
to the fire, but he was not silenced.</p>
<p>&#8220;That reminds me, Bucks,&#8221; he resumed after a
pause, &#8220;there is another friend of yours here at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
the door, waiting to congratulate you. Shall I let
him in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want any congratulations, Bob.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll promise he doesn&#8217;t say a single word,
Bucks.&#8221; As he spoke, Scott opened the hall door
and whistled into the darkness. For an instant
there was no response. Then a small and vague
object outlined itself in the gloom, but halted questioningly
on the threshold. Wagging his abbreviated
tail very gently and carrying his drooping
ears very low, Scuffy at length walked slowly into
the room. Bucks hailed him with delight, and
Scuffy bounding forward crouched at his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do a thing with him over at the ranch,&#8221;
complained Scott, eying the dog with a secret admiration.
&#8220;He is eating the hounds up; doesn&#8217;t
give them a chance to pick a bone even after he&#8217;s
done with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid there is nothing to do with Scuffy,
but to make a despatcher of him,&#8221; returned
Bucks, picking him up by the forepaws. &#8220;I can
see very plainly it&#8217;s going to be a dog&#8217;s life most
of the time.&#8221;</p>
